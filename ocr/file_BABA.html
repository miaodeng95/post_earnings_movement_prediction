Alibaba Group Announces June Quarter 2025 Results

Hangzhou, China, August 29, 2025 - Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA and HKEX: 9988
(HKD Counter) and 89988 (RMB Counter), “Alibaba” or “Alibaba Group”) today announced its financial
results for the quarter ended June 30, 2025.

“This quarter, our strategic focus on consumption and AI + Cloud delivered strong growth. Our decisive
investment in the quick commerce business achieved key milestones as we won consumer mindshare. We
generated substantial synergies from combining resources of our consumer platforms which resulted in new
highs in monthly active consumers and daily order volume. Driven by robust AI demand, Cloud Intelligence
Group experienced accelerated revenue growth, and AlI-related product revenue is now a significant portion
of revenue from external customers. Looking ahead, we remain committed to investing in our two strategic
pillars of consumption and AI + Cloud to capture historic opportunities and drive long-term growth,” said
Eddie Wu, Chief Executive Officer of Alibaba Group.

“Our core businesses delivered strong revenue growth. Customer management revenue grew 10% and
revenue from Cloud Intelligence Group grew 26%, with Al-related product revenue achieving triple-digit
growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. The strength of our core businesses gives us confidence and
resources to make significant investments in quick commerce and AI initiatives. We also executed well
against our commitment to improve operating efficiency, as AIDC significantly narrowed its loss to
approach breakeven this quarter.” said Toby Xu, Chief Financial Officer of Alibaba Group.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

In the quarter ended June 30, 2025:

e Revenue was RMB247,652 million (US$34,571 million), an increase of 2% year-over-year.
Excluding revenue from the disposed businesses of Sun Art and Intime, revenue on a like-for-like
basis would have grown by 10% year-over-year.

e Income from operations was RMB34,988 million (US$4,884 million), a decrease of 3% year-
over-year, primarily due to the decrease in adjusted EBITA, partly offset by the decrease in
amortization of intangible assets, non-cash share-based compensation expense, and a one-time
provision in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITA, a non-GAAP measurement, decreased
14% year-over-year to RMB38,844 million (US$5,422 million), primarily attributable to the
investment in “Taobao Instant Commerce”, as well as user experiences, user acquisition and
technology, partly offset by double-digit revenue growth in Alibaba China E-commerce Group,
and improved operating efficiencies across various businesses.

e Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB43,116 million (US$6,019
million). Net income was RMB42,382 million (US$5,916 million), an increase of 76% year-
over-year, primarily due to mark-to-market changes from our equity investments and gain from
the disposal of local consumer service business of Trendyol, partly offset by the decrease in
income from operations. Non-GAAP net income in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 was
RMB33,510 million (US$4,678 million), a decrease of 18% compared to RMB40,691 million in
the same quarter of 2024.

e Diluted earnings per ADS was RMB17.98 (US$2.51). Diluted earnings per share was
RMB2.25 (US$0.31 or HK$2.47). Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS was RMB14.75
(US$2.06), a decrease of 10% year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was
RMB1.84 (US$0.26 or HK$2.02), a decrease of 10% year-over-year.

e Net cash provided by operating activities was RMB20,672 million (US$2,886 million), a
decrease of 39% compared to RMB33,636 million in the same quarter of 2024. Free cash flow, a
non-GAAP measurement of liquidity, was an outflow of RMB18,815 million (US$2,626
million), compared to an inflow of RMB17,372 million in the same quarter of 2024. The
decrease in free cash flow was mainly attributed to the increase in our cloud infrastructure
expenditure and the investment in “Taobao Instant Commerce”. As of June 30, 2025, our cash
and other liquid investments) were RMB585,663 million (US$81,755 million).

Reconciliations of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures presented above are included at the end of this
results announcement.

included in equity securities and other investments on the consolidated balance sheets, of which that are unrestricted for
withdrawal and use.

BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC UPDATES

To advance our “user first” strategy and enhance user experience, during the quarter ended June 30, 2025,
we undertook a strategic combination of Taobao and Tmall Group, Ele.me and Fliggy into Alibaba China E-
commerce Group. We simplified the financial reporting structure by reclassifying Cainiao, Amap and Digital
Media and Entertainment Group (rebranded to Hujing Digital Media and Entertainment Group, “Hujing
DME”) into “All others”. Based on this strategic re-alignment, starting from this quarter, our segment
reporting will present the following: (1) Alibaba China E-commerce Group, (2) Alibaba International Digital
Commerce Group, (3) Cloud Intelligence Group and (4) All others.

Alibaba China E-commerce Group

We launched “Taobao Instant Commerce” service on the Taobao app at the end of April to meet consumer
needs for on-demand delivery across a wide range of product categories, including food, groceries,
electronics and apparel. This initiative strengthened the Taobao app’s leadership in China’s e-commerce
industry. Our significant investment in quick commerce focused on building consumer mindshare and
business scale, which contributed to the 25% year-over-year increase in monthly active consumers on the
Taobao app in the first three weeks of August. As part of our quick commerce strategy, we expanded our
product offerings and front warehouse coverage for non-food categories. While continuing to improve user
experience and enhance operating efficiency, we executed our plan to generate synergies between quick
commerce and the rest of Alibaba’s ecosystem by leveraging supply chains, users and membership benefits
across our businesses.

Customer management revenue grew 10% year-over-year to RMB89,252 million (US$12,459 million)
during the quarter, primarily driven by the improvement of take rate, which benefited from the addition of
software service fees in September last year and increasing penetration of Quanzhantui.

We had a successful 6.18 Shopping Festival, which delivered strong consumer growth year-over-year on the
Taobao app, as we implemented user-friendly promotion mechanisms and increased support for merchants
that provide high-quality products and customer services.

The number of 88VIP members, our highest spending consumer group, continued to increase by double
digits year-over-year, surpassing 53 million. We will continue to focus on improving the retention of 88 VIP
membership through enhanced value proposition to our most valued customers.

Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group (“AIDC”)

For the quarter ended June 30, 2025, revenue from AIDC grew 19% year-over-year to RMB34,741 million
(US$4,850 million), primarily driven by strong performance in cross-border businesses. While maintaining a
strategic emphasis on key regions, AIDC remained focused on operating efficiency, leading to significantly
narrowed losses year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. The unit economics of the AliExpress’ Choice
business continued to improve meaningfully, primarily due to logistics optimization and investment
efficiency enhancement. The unit economics of Trendyol’s International business also improved quarter-
over-quarter.

AIDC’s international commerce retail businesses, AliExpress and Trendyol in particular, continued to
diversify and enrich product offerings by engaging local merchants and partners through different business
models in different markets. Our international wholesale platform saw broader adoption by merchants of its
Al-powered tools for marketing, procurement and product listing, which provided multiple ways for the
platform to monetize. We believe that our diverse businesses, comprehensive product offerings and
technological strengths across geographies will bring competitive advantages in the long run set against the
backdrop of a rapidly evolving global e-commerce landscape.

Cloud Intelligence Group

For the quarter ended June 30, 2025, revenue from Cloud Intelligence Group was RMB33,398 million
(US$4,662 million), an increase of 26% year-over-year. During this quarter, the year-over-year growth of
revenue excluding Alibaba-consolidated subsidiaries also accelerated to 26%. This momentum was
primarily driven by public cloud revenue growth, including the increasing adoption of Al-related products.

Al-related product revenue maintained triple-digit year-over-year growth for the eighth consecutive quarter.
As AI demand continues to grow rapidly, we are also seeing increased demand of compute, storage and other
public cloud services to support AI adoption. We will continue to invest in anticipation of customer growth
and technology innovation, including AI products and services, to increase cloud adoption for AI and
maintain our market leadership.

Alibaba Cloud’s strong position in providing critical infrastructure for the GenAI market has been
highlighted in Omdia’s “Market Radar: GenAI Cloud Titans in Asia & Oceania 2025” report, which pointed
to our full-stack GenAI solutions, comprehensive and developer-friendly AI platform offering and open-
source initiatives. The report emphasized that through Model Studio and Platform for AI (PAI), Alibaba
Cloud offers enterprises a user-friendly environment for building and deploying GenAI applications.

Share Repurchases

During the quarter ended June 30, 2025, we repurchased a total of 56 million ordinary shares (equivalent to 7
million ADSs) for a total of US$815 million. These purchases were made in the U.S. market under our share
repurchase program. The remaining amount of Board authorization for our share repurchase program, which
is effective through March 2027, was US$19.3 billion as of June 30, 2025.

Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures” for more information about the non-GAAP measures referred to within this results
announcement.

The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the decrease in adjusted EBITA, partly offset by the decrease in
amortization of intangible assets, non-cash share-based compensation expense, and a one-time provision in the same quarter
last year.

The year-over-year decreases were primarily attributable to the investment in “Taobao Instant Commerce”, as well as user
experiences, user acquisition and technology, partly offset by double-digit revenue growth in Alibaba China E-commerce
Group, and improved operating efficiencies across various businesses.

The year-over-year increases were primarily due to mark-to-market changes from our equity investments and gain from the
disposal of local consumer service business of Trendyol, partly offset by the decrease in income from operations, while net
income attributable to ordinary shareholders and earnings per share/ADS would further take into account the net loss
(income) attributable to noncontrolling interests and (accretion) reversal of accretion of mezzanine equity. We excluded non-
cash share-based compensation expense, gains/losses of investments, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and
certain other items from our non-GAAP measurements.

Each ADS represents eight ordinary shares.

The year-over-year percentages as stated are calculated based on the exact amount and there may be minor differences from
the year-over-year percentages calculated based on the RMB amounts after rounding.

Cost of revenue — Cost of revenue in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 was RMB136,429 million
(US$19,045 million), or 55.1% of revenue, compared to RMB146,106 million, or 60.1% of revenue, in the
same quarter of 2024. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, cost of revenue as a
percentage of revenue would have decreased from 59.8% in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 to 54.9% in the
quarter ended June 30, 2025, primarily due to disposal of Sun Art and Intime businesses, decrease in scale of
low margin direct sales businesses, and improvement in monetization and operating efficiency.

Product development expenses — Product development expenses in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 were
RMB15,001 million (US$2,094 million), or 6.1% of revenue, compared to RMB13,373 million, or 5.5% of
revenue, in the same quarter of 2024. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, product
development expenses as a percentage of revenue would have increased from 4.8% in the quarter ended
June 30, 2024 to 5.5% in the quarter ended June 30, 2025.

Sales and marketing expenses — Sales and marketing expenses in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 were
RMB353,178 million (US$7,423 million), or 21.5% of revenue, compared to RMB32,696 million, or 13.4%
of revenue, in the same quarter of 2024. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, sales and
marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue would have increased from 13.3% in the quarter ended June
30, 2024 to 21.3% in the quarter ended June 30, 2025, primarily attributable to the investment in “Taobao
Instant Commerce”, as well as user experiences and user acquisition of Alibaba China E-commerce Group.

General and administrative expenses — General and administrative expenses in the quarter ended June 30,
2025 were RMB7,398 million (US$1,033 million), or 3.0% of revenue, compared to RMB13,280 million, or
5.5% of revenue, in the same quarter of 2024. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense,
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue would have decreased from 4.9% in the
quarter ended June 30, 2024 to 2.5% in the quarter ended June 30, 2025, primarily due to a one-time
provision for the shareholder class action lawsuits in the same quarter last year.

Share-based compensation expense — Total share-based compensation expense included in the cost and
expense items above in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 was RMB3,545 million (US$495 million),
compared to RMB4,131 million in the same quarter of 2024.

(1) This represents Alibaba Group share-based awards granted to our employees.
(2) This represents share-based awards of our subsidiaries and Ant Group granted to our employees.
(3) This includes both cash and non-cash share-based compensation expenses.

Share-based compensation expense decreased in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same
quarter of 2024. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of Alibaba Group share-
based awards granted as we have increased the proportion of long-term cash incentives granted after
considering the macroeconomic environment and the general trends in the talent market.

We expect that our share-based compensation expense will continue to be affected by changes in the fair
value of the underlying awards and the quantity of awards we grant in the future.

Amortization and impairment of intangible assets — Amortization and impairment of intangible assets in
the quarter ended June 30, 2025 was RMB807 million (US$113 million), a decrease of 55% from
RMBI1,792 million in the same quarter of 2024, primarily due to full amortization of certain intangible
assets.

Income from operations in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 was RMB34,988 million (US$4,884 million), or
14% of revenue, a decrease of 3% compared to RMB35,989 million, or 15% of revenue, in the same quarter
of 2024, primarily due to the decrease in adjusted EBITA, partly offset by the decrease in amortization of
intangible assets, non-cash share-based compensation expense, and a one-time provision in the same quarter
last year.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITA

Adjusted EBITDA decreased 11% year-over-year to RMB45,735 million (US$6,384 million) in the quarter
ended June 30, 2025, compared to RMBS51,161 million in the same quarter of 2024. Adjusted EBITA
decreased 14% year-over-year to RMB38,844 million (US$5,422 million) in the quarter ended June 30,
2025, compared to RMB45,035 million in the same quarter of 2024, primarily attributable to the investment
in “Taobao Instant Commerce”, as well as user experiences, user acquisition and technology, partly offset by
double-digit revenue growth in Alibaba China E-commerce Group, and improved operating efficiencies
across various businesses. A reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITA is
included at the end of this results announcement.

Adjusted EBITA by segment

Adjusted EBITA by segment as well as a reconciliation of income from operations to adjusted EBITA are
set forth in the section entitled “June Quarter Segment Results” above.

Interest and investment income, net

(US$2,426 million), compared to a loss of RMB1,478 million in the same quarter of 2024, primarily due to
mark-to-market changes from our equity investments and gain from the disposal of local consumer service
business of Trendyol.

The above-mentioned investment gains and losses were excluded from our non-GAAP net income.
Other income, net

Other income, net in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 was RMB348 million (US$48 million), an increase of
35% compared to RMB257 million in the same quarter of 2024.

(US$141 million), a decrease of 33% compared to RMB1,505 million in the same quarter of 2024. The
following table sets forth a breakdown of share of results of equity method investees for the periods
indicated:

Three months ended June 30,
2024 2025

RMB RMB USS
(in millions)

Share of profit (loss) of equity method investees

- Ant Group 3,917 1,547 216
- Others (588) 455 63
Impairment loss (2,157) - -
Others 333 (989) (138)
Total 1,505 1,013 141

(1) “Others” mainly include basis differences arising from equity method investees, share-based compensation expense related to
share-based awards granted to employees of our equity method investees, as well as gain or loss arising from the deemed
disposal of the equity method investees.

We record our share of results of all equity method investees one quarter in arrears. The year-over-year
decrease in share of profit of Ant Group was mainly attributable to investments in new growth initiatives
and technologies, and the decrease in fair value of certain investments.

Net income and Non-GAAP net income

Our net income in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 was RMB42,382 million (US$5,916 million), compared
to RMB24,022 million in the same quarter of 2024, primarily due to mark-to-market changes from our
equity investments and gain from the disposal of local consumer service business of Trendyol, partly offset
by the decrease in income from operations.

Excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense, gains/losses of investments, impairment of goodwill
and intangible assets, and certain other items, non-GAAP net income in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 was
RMB33,510 million (US$4,678 million), a decrease of 18% compared to RMB40,691 million in the same
quarter of 2024. A reconciliation of net income to non-GAAP net income is included at the end of this results
announcement.

Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders

Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 was RMB43,116
million (US$6,019 million), compared to RMB24,269 million in the same quarter of 2024, primarily due to
mark-to-market changes from our equity investments and gain from the disposal of local consumer service
business of Trendyol, partly offset by the decrease in income from operations.

Diluted earnings per ADS/share and non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS/share

Diluted earnings per ADS in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 was RMB17.98 (US$2.51), compared to
RMB9.89 in the same quarter of 2024. Excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense, gains/losses
of investments, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and certain other items, non-GAAP diluted
earnings per ADS in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 was RMB14.75 (US$2.06), a decrease of 10%
compared to RMB16.44 in the same quarter of 2024.

Diluted earnings per share in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 was RMB2.25 (US$0.31 or HK$2.47),
compared to RMB1.24 in the same quarter of 2024. Excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense,
gains/losses of investments, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and certain other items, non-
GAAP diluted earnings per share in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 was RMB1.84 (US$0.26 or HK$2.02),
a decrease of 10% compared to RMB2.05 in the same quarter of 2024.

A reconciliation of diluted earnings per ADS/share to non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS/share is
included at the end of this results announcement. Each ADS represents eight ordinary shares.

Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury investments

As of June 30, 2025, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury investments
included in equity securities and other investments on the consolidated balance sheets, of which that are
unrestricted for withdrawal and use, were RMB585,663 million (US$81,755 million), compared to
RMBS597,132 million as of March 31, 2025. Other treasury investments mainly include investments in fixed
deposits, certificate of deposits and marketable debt securities with original maturities over one year for
treasury purposes. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury
investments of RMB11,469 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2025, was primarily due to (i) free
cash flow outflow of RMB18,815 million (US$2,626 million), (ii) cash outflow of RMB8,429 million
(US$1,177 million) for investment and acquisition activities, and (iii) cash used in repurchase of ordinary
shares of RMBS5,840 million (US$815 million), partly offset by (iv) cash inflow of RMB17,457 million
(US$2,437 million) from disposal of investments, and (v) net proceeds from bank borrowings of RMB3,287
million (US$459 million).

Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow

During the quarter ended June 30, 2025, net cash provided by operating activities was RMB20,672 million
(US$2,886 million), a decrease of 39% compared to RMB33,636 million in the same quarter of 2024. Free
cash flow, anon-GAAP measurement of liquidity, was an outflow of RMB18,815 million (US$2,626
million), compared to an inflow of RMB17,372 million in the same quarter of 2024. The decrease in free
cash flow was mainly attributed to the increase in our cloud infrastructure expenditure and the investment in
“Taobao Instant Commerce”. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow
is included at the end of this results announcement.

Net cash provided by investing activities

During the quarter ended June 30, 2025, net cash provided by investing activities of RMB18,328 million
(US$2,558 million) primarily reflected a decrease in short-term investments by RMB35,652 million
(US$4,977 million), cash inflow of RMB17,457 million (US$2,437 million) from disposal of investments,
and a decrease in other treasury investments by RMB12,364 million (US$1,726 million). These cash inflows
were partly offset by capital expenditures of RMB38,676 million (US$5,399 million) and cash outflow of
RMB8,429 million (US$1,177 million) for investment and acquisition activities.

Net cash used in financing activities

During the quarter ended June 30, 2025, net cash used in financing activities of RMB2,731 million (US$381
million) primarily reflected cash used in repurchase of ordinary shares of RMB5,840 million (US$815 million),
partly offset by net proceeds from bank borrowings of RMB3,287 million (US$459 million).

Employees

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with
GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: for our consolidated results, adjusted EBITDA
(including adjusted EBITDA margin), adjusted EBITA (including adjusted EBITA margin), non-GAAP net
income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS and free cash flow. For more information on these non-
GAAP financial measures, please refer to the table captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to the
Nearest Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures” in this results announcement.

We believe that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings
per share/ADS help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect
of certain income or expenses that we include in income from operations, net income and diluted earnings per
share/ADS. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about our core operating
results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater
visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.
We present three different income measures, namely adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA and non-GAAP net
income in order to provide more information and greater transparency to investors about our operating results.

We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and

15

investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic corporate
transactions, including investing in our new business initiatives, making strategic investments and acquisitions
and strengthening our balance sheet.

Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS and
free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to income from operations,
net income, diluted earnings per share/ADS, cash flows or any other measure of performance or as an indicator
of our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here do not have standardized
meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by
other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness
as comparative measures to our data.

Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest and investment income, net, interest expense, other
income (expense), net, income tax expenses, share of results of equity method investees, certain non-cash
expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization and impairment of intangible assets,
impairment of goodwill, depreciation and impairment of property and equipment, and operating lease cost
relating to land use rights, and others (including provision in relation to matters outside the ordinary course of
business), which we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the periods
presented.

Adjusted EBITA represents net income before interest and investment income, net, interest expense, other
income (expense), net, income tax expenses, share of results of equity method investees, certain non-cash
expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization and impairment of intangible assets,
impairment of goodwill, and others (including provision in relation to matters outside the ordinary course of
business), which we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the periods
presented.

Non-GAAP net income represents net income before non-cash share-based compensation expense,
amortization and impairment of intangible assets, gain or loss on deemed disposals/disposals/revaluation of
investments, impairment of goodwill and investments, and others (including provision in relation to matters
outside the ordinary course of business), and adjustments for the tax effects.

Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share represents non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary
shareholders divided by the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares for computing non-
GAAP diluted earnings per share on a diluted basis. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS represents non-
GAAP diluted earnings per share after adjusting for the ordinary share-to-ADS ratio.

Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities as presented in our consolidated cash flow
statement less purchases of property and equipment (excluding acquisition of land use rights and construction
in progress relating to office campuses) and intangible assets (excluding those acquired through acquisitions),
as well as adjustments to exclude from net cash provided by operating activities the buyer protection fund
deposits from merchants on our marketplaces. We deduct certain items of cash flows from investing activities
in order to provide greater transparency into cash flow from our revenue-generating business operations. We
exclude “acquisition of land use rights and construction in progress relating to office campuses” because the
office campuses are used by us for corporate and administrative purposes and are not directly related to our
revenue-generating business operations. We also exclude buyer protection fund deposits from merchants on
our marketplaces because these deposits are restricted for the purpose of compensating buyers for claims
against merchants.

The table captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to the Nearest Comparable U.S. GAAP
Measures” in this results announcement has more details on the non-GAAP financial measures that are most
directly comparable to GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial
measures.
