Intel Reports Second-Quarter 2025 Financial Results

News Release

News Summary
= Second-quarter revenue was $12.9 billion, flat year-over-year (YoY).

»  Second-quarter earnings (loss) per share (EPS) attributable to Intel was $(0.67); non-GAAP EPS attributable to
Intel was $(0.10).

= $(0.45) impact to GAAP EPS attributable to Intel from $1.9 billion of restructuring charges; $(0.23) and $(0.20)
impact to GAAP and non-GAAP EPS attributable to Intel, respectively, from $800 million of impairment charges
and $200 million in one-time period costs.

« Forecasting third-quarter 2025 revenue of $12.6 billion to $13.6 billion; expecting third-quarter EPS attributable
to Intel of $(0.24) and non-GAAP EPS attributable to Intel of $0.00.

* Taking actions to drive improved execution and efficiency; continue to target $17 billion of non-GAAP" operating
expenses in 2025 and $16 billion in 2026; $18 billion in gross capital expenditures for 2025.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., July 24, 2025 — Intel Corporation today reported second-quarter 2025 financial results.

“Our operating performance demonstrates the initial progress we are making to improve our execution and drive
greater efficiency,” said Lip-Bu Tan, Intel CEO. “We are laser-focused on strengthening our core product portfolio
and our Al roadmap to better serve customers. We are also taking the actions needed to build a more financially
disciplined foundry. It’s going to take time, but we see clear opportunities to enhance our competitive position,
improve our profitability and create long-term shareholder value.”

“Our results reflect solid demand across our business and good execution on our priorities,” said David Zinsner,
Intel CFO. “The changes we are making to reduce our operating costs, improve our capital efficiency and monetize
non-core assets are having a positive impact as we work to strengthen our balance sheet and position the business
for the future.”

Progress on Driving Greater Efficiency and Execution

Intel continues to make progress to simplify its business, improve efficiency and enhance execution. These efforts
are focused on reducing expenses, strengthening the balance sheet, optimizing the global footprint and
concentrating resources on the most critical growth areas.

* On track to achieve $17 billion non-GAAP operating expense’ target for 2025: Intel has completed the
majority of the planned headcount actions it announced last quarter to reduce its core workforce by
approximately 15%. These changes are designed to create a faster-moving, flatter and more agile
organization. As a result of these actions, the company recognized $1.9 billion in restructuring charges in
the second quarter of 2025, which were excluded from its non-GAAP results. These charges impacted
GAAP EPS by $(0.45) per share. Intel plans to end the year with a core workforce of about 75,000
employees as a result of workforce reductions and attrition.

¢ Improving capital efficiency; driving to gross capital expenditures? of $18 billion for 2025: Intel is
taking action to optimize its manufacturing footprint and drive greater returns on invested capital. As part of
this effort, Intel will no longer move forward with planned projects in Germany and Poland. The company
also intends to consolidate its assembly and test operations in Costa Rica into its larger sites in Vietnam
and Malaysia. In addition, Intel will further slow the pace of construction in Ohio to ensure spending is
aligned with market demand.

Exhibit 99.1

Intel also recognized approximately $800 million of non-cash impairment and accelerated depreciation charges
related to excess tools with no identified re-use and approximately $200 million of one-time period costs in the
second quarter of 2025. These charges reduced both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin by approximately 800
basis points and GAAP and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $(0.23) and $(0.20) cents per share, respectively.

These restructuring charges and impairments were not incorporated into the guidance Intel provided for the second
quarter of 2025.

" Non-GAAP operating expense refers to non-GAAP R&D and marketing, general and administrative (MG&A). See below for more information on

and reconciliations of Intel's non-GAAP financial measures.
2 Gross capital expenditures refers to GAAP additions to property, plant and equipment.

Business Highlights

« — Intel launched three new additions to its Intel® Xeon® 6 series of central processing units (CPUs),
delivering customizable CPU core frequencies to boost graphics processing unit (GPU) performance across
demanding Al workloads. One of these, the Intel® Xeon® 6776P processor, currently serves as the host
CPU for NVIDIA DGX B300, the company’s latest generation of Al-accelerated systems.

« The first Panther Lake processor SKU remains on track to begin shipping later this year, with additional
SKUs coming in the first half of 2026.

« Intel 18A reached a key milestone with the start of production wafers in Arizona.

= Intel made key leadership appointments, including Greg Ernst as chief revenue officer and Srinivasan

lyengar, Jean-Didier Allegrucci and Shailendra Desai in key engineering leadership roles.

* In line with Intel’s commitment to strengthen its balance sheet and monetize non-core assets, the company
sold, via a secondary offering, 57.5 million of net Class A shares of Mobileye in July 2025, adding
approximately $922 million to the balance sheet. Intel remains the majority shareholder in Mobileye and
continues to have strong conviction in its long-term growth opportunity.

Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures

In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document references non-GAAP
financial measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful
supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results
between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater
transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our
performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus
plans.

Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the
related effects to income taxes and net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests effects. Income tax
effects are calculated using a fixed long-term projected tax rate. For 2025 and 2024, we determined the projected
non-GAAP tax rate to be 12% and 13%, respectively. We project this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on at least an
annual basis using a five-year non-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each
adjustment. The projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure, our tax positions in
various jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax
rate may be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment,
significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business operations.
Management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing internal short- and long-term operating plans and in
evaluating our performance; we believe this approach facilitates comparison of our operating results and provides
useful evaluation of our current operating performance. Non-GAAP adjustments attributable to non-controlling
interests are calculated by adjusting for the minority stockholder portion of non-GAAP adjustments we make for
relevant acquisition-related costs, share-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, and income tax
effects, as applicable to each majority-owned subsidiary.

Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures
calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and
reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.
