NEWARK, Caalif., Aug. 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: LCID), maker of the world's most advanced electric vehicles, today
announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2025. The earnings presentation is available on its investor relations website

billion in total liquidity. The Company is also adjusting its production outlook for 2025 to 18,000 - 20,000 vehicles.

second half of the year," said Marc Winterhoff, Interim CEO at Lucid. "In Q1, we mentioned our ongoing partnership discussions to develop new
revenue streams for our EV technology and beyond. The robotaxi partnership we announced with Uber and Nuro is a perfect example aligned with
that strategy. We also continued to double down on increasing our brand awareness, introducing Timothée Chalamet, an award-winning actor and
cultural icon, as our first global brand ambassador."

"We delivered solid performance despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop, thanks to the adaptability and focus of our team in navigating a
dynamic environment," said Taoufiq Boussaid, CFO at Lucid. "We are focused on business fundamentals to achieve our near-term goals: disciplined
cost management, brand building, and continuing to execute our Lucid Gravity launch ramp. We remain committed to strengthening our balance sheet

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Business Metrics

Condensed consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with US GAAP ("GAAP") as well as on a non-GAAP basis to
supplement our condensed consolidated financial results. Lucid's non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss
attributable to common stockholders (diluted), adjusted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders (diluted), and free cash flow, which are
discussed below.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss attributable to common stockholders (basic) before (1) interest expense, (2) interest income, (3) provision for
(benefit from) income taxes, (4) depreciation and amortization, (5) stock-based compensation, (6) restructuring charges, (7) change in fair value of
common stock warrant liability, (8) change in fair value of equity securities of a related party, (9) change in fair value of derivative liabilities associated
with redeemable convertible preferred stock (related party), (10) accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock (related party), and (11) gain on
extinguishment of debt. Lucid believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to Lucid's management and investors about Lucid's financial
performance.

Adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders (diluted) is defined as net loss attributable to common stockholders (diluted) excluding (1)
stock-based compensation, (2) restructuring charges, (3) change in fair value of common stock warrant liability, (4) change in fair value of equity
securities of a related party, (5) change in fair value of derivative liabilities associated with redeemable convertible preferred stock (related party), and
(6) accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock (related party).

Lucid defines and calculates adjusted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders (diluted) as adjusted net loss attributable to common
stockholders (diluted) divided by weighted-average shares outstanding attributable to common stockholders (diluted).

Lucid believes that adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders (diluted) and adjusted net loss per share attributable to common
stockholders (diluted) financial measures provide investors with useful information to evaluate performance of its business excluding items not
reflecting ongoing operating activities.

Free cash flow is defined as net cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures. Lucid believes that free cash flow provides useful
information to Lucid's management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures.

These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to Lucid's historical performance. Management believes that it is
useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its
operating, budgeting, and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides
useful information to Lucid's investors regarding measures of our financial condition and results of operations that Lucid uses to run the business and
therefore allows investors to better understand Lucid's performance. However, these non-GAAP financial and key performance measures have
limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.

Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial
information reported under GAAP when understanding Lucid's operating performance. In addition, other companies, including companies in Lucid's
industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their
performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of Lucid's non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures as tools for
comparison. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is presented below.
