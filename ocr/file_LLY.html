driven by robust sales of Zepbound and Mounjaro and sustained momentum across our key medicines,”

Second-Quarter Reported Results

In Q2 2025, worldwide revenue was $15.56 billion, an increase of 38% compared with Q2 2024, driven by
a 42% increase in volume, partially offset by a 6% decrease due to lower realized prices. Key Products’

revenue grew to $10.40 billion in Q2 2025, led by Zepbound and Mounjaro.

Revenue in the U.S. increased 38% to $10.81 billion, driven by a 46% increase in volume, partially offset
by an 8% decrease due to lower realized prices. The increase in U.S. volume and decline in realized

prices was driven by Zepbound and Mounjaro.

Revenue outside the U.S. increased 37% to $4.74 billion, driven by a 35% increase in volume and to a
lesser extent a 3% favorable impact on foreign exchange rates, partially offset by a 1% decrease due to

lower realized prices. The volume increase outside the U.S. was driven primarily by Mounjaro.

Gross margin increased 44% to $13.11 billion in Q2 2025. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was
84.3%, an increase of 3.5 percentage points. The increase in gross margin percent was primarily driven

by improved cost of production and favorable product mix, partially offset by lower realized prices.

‘The Company defines Key Products as Ebglyss, Jaypirca, Kisunla, Mounjaro, Omvoh, Verzenio, and Zepbound.

2

In Q2 2025, research and development expenses increased 23% to $3.34 billion, or 21.4% of revenue,

driven by continued investments in the company's early and late-stage portfolio.

Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 30% to $2.75 billion in Q2 2025, primarily

driven by promotional efforts supporting ongoing and future launches.

There were no asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges in Q2 2025. In Q2 2024, there

was a charge of $435.0 million, which related to litigation.

The effective tax rate was 16.5% in Q2 2025 compared with 15.6% in Q2 2024. The lower tax rate in Q2
2024 reflects the favorable tax impact of asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges in Q2
2024.

In Q2 2025, net income and earnings per share (EPS) were $5.66 billion and $6.29, respectively,

compared with net income of $2.97 billion and EPS of $3.28 in Q2 2024. EPS in Q2 2025 and Q2 2024
both included acquired IPR&D charges of $0.14.

Second-Quarter Non-GAAP Measures

On a non-GAAP basis, Q2 2025 gross margin increased 43% to $13.23 billion. Gross margin as a percent
of revenue was 85.0%, an increase of 3.0 percentage points. The increase in gross margin percent was
primarily driven by improved cost of production and favorable product mix, partially offset by lower

realized prices.

On a non-GAAP basis, Q2 2025 net income and EPS were $5.68 billion and $6.31, respectively,
compared with net income of $3.54 billion and EPS of $3.92 in Q2 2024. Non-GAAP EPS in Q2 2025 and
Q2 2024 both included acquired IPR&D charges of $0.14.

2025 Financial Guidance

Full year guidance increased to the range of $60.0 billion to $62.0 billion, primarily driven by strong

underlying business performance across the portfolio and foreign exchange rates.

The performance margin’ is now expected to be in the range of 42.0% and 43.5% on a reported basis

and 43.0% and 44.5% on a non-GAAP basis. Both ratios reflecting the increase in revenue guidance.

Other income (expense) on a reported basis is now expected to be expense in the range of $750 million
to $650 million due to a decrease in net losses on investments in equity securities and is still expected to

be expense in the range of $700 million to $600 million on a non-GAAP basis.

The 2025 estimated effective tax rate increased from approximately 17% on a reported basis to 19%
which reflects an anticipated third quarter charge as a result of recently enacted U.S. tax legislation. The

non-GAAP estimated tax rate is still expected to be approximately 17%.

Based on these changes, EPS guidance increased to the range of $20.85 to $22.10 on a reported basis
and $21.75 to $23.00 on a non-GAAP basis. The company's updated 2025 financial guidance reflects

adjustments shown in the reconciliation table below.
