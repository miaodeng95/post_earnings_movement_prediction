— in 2025

“We delivered another strong quarter, reflecting our focus on operational excellence and disciplined execution, keeping
us on track to meet our 2025 guidances. Safety remains a core value, and we're encouraged by the clear progress toward
an accident-free work environment across our operations. As we advance in our strategy to strengthen our flexible
product portfolio, we continue to lower costs and build resilience, which will help us navigate well in any market scenario.
This quarter, we also reached a key milestone as our first copper mine project under the New Carajds program obtained
its preliminary license, marking tangible progress toward future growth. These achievements reaffirm our strategy and
demonstrate our commitment to building a leading mining platform that creates long-term value for all stakeholders.",
commented Gustavo Pimenta, Chief Executive Officer.

Results Highlights

© Operational and cost performance improved across all business segments; all guidances on track. Copper and nickel
sales increased 17% (12.9 kt) and 21% (7.0 kt) y/y, respectively. Iron ore shipments declined 3% (2.4 Mt) y/y, reflecting the
ongoing portfolio optimization strategy.

¢  Theaverage realized iron ore fines price was US$ 85.1/t, 6% lower q/q and 13% lower y/y, in line with the broader decline
in iron ore reference prices.

© Iron ore fines’ C1 cash cost, excluding third-party purchases, decreased by 11% y/y, reaching US$ 22.2/t, marking the
fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year cost reduction.

¢  All-in costs were down 10% in iron ore (US$ 55.3/t), 60% in copper (US$ 1,450/t), and 30% in nickel (US$ 12,396/t) y/y,
as a result of the implementation of efficiency initiatives and higher production.

© Copper all-in cost guidance for 2025 revised down to US$ 1,500-2,000/t (from US$ 2,800-3,300/t), driven by solid
operational performance and higher-than-expected gold prices.

¢ Proforma EBITDA totaled US$ 3.4 billion, 7% higher q/q and 14% lower y/y. The strong performance of copper and
nickel segments, along with lower C1 cash cost in iron ore, partly offset the impact of weaker commodity prices.

© Capital expenditures of US$ 1.1 billion were US$ 0.2 billion lower y/y, on track to meet the 2025 guidance of US$ 5.9
billion and reflecting ongoing efficiency initiatives.

© Recurring free cash flow generation was US$ 1.0 billion, US$ 0.8 billion higher y/y, as a result of more favorable working
capital variation and lower capital expenditures.

¢ Expanded net debt of US$ 17.4 billion as of June 30 was US$ 0.8 billion lower q/q, mainly driven by free cash flow
generation.

© Approval of US$ 1.448 billion in interest on capital to be paid in September 2025, implying an annualized yield of 7%".

Business Iron Ore Solutions

Highlights + The first shipment of the Capanema project was completed in Q2. The project will add 15 Mtpy of
x net iron ore capacity, with ramp-up completion expected in the first half of 2026. This expansion will
O support the company’s production guidance for 2025 (325-335 Mt).
oN Energy Transition Metals

+ Vale Base Metals obtained the Preliminary License for the Bacaba project in June. The project is
designed to extend the life of the Sossego Mining Complex, contributing with an average annual copper
production of around 50 ktpy over an 8-year mine life. Approximately US$ 290 million will be invested
during the project’s implementation phase, and the production start-up is planned for the 1H28.

* Vale's Waste-to-Value program continues to advance, transforming waste and tailings into valuable
resources. The program currently encompasses 150 initiatives, including the tailings reprocessing
operation in Gelado and Vargem Grande dams and the WH wastepile in Capanema. In the 1H25, Vale
produced around 9 Mt from circularity sources, 14% higher than the same period in 2024.

Forest protection

* Vale has achieved 200,000 hectares of forest conserved, representing 50% of its 2030 voluntary
target. The company currently supports forest protection efforts across 1 million hectares worldwide,
including 800,000 hectares in the Amazon in collaboration with ICMBio.

Transparency

+ Vale published its sustainability-related financial disclosures report, available here, marking a
significant step in alignment with international ISSB standards and Brazilian CBPS Sustainability
Disclosure Pronouncements. The voluntary disclosure anticipates regulatory requirements under CVM
Resolution 193/23 by two years, underscoring Vale’s commitment to transparency and the continued
evolution of its climate and sustainability reporting practices.

Reparation Brumadinho

BA + The Brumadinho Integral Reparation Agreement continues to progress, with approximately 77% of
RA the agreed-upon commitments completed by 2025 and in accordance with the deadlines outlined in
the settlement. In addition, R$ 3.9 billion has been paid in individual compensation since 2019.

Mariana

+ The Samarco reparation program continues to progress, with R$ 60 billion disbursed as of June 30,
2025. The definitive compensation program (PID) exceeded initial expectations with formal adherence
from over 290,000 individuals. This strong level of engagement reflects the success of the agreement
and highlights the effectiveness in resolving the underlying claims through a transparent and

structured process.

EBITDA

Proforma EBITDA was US$ 3.4 billion in 2025, 14% lower y/y, mainly as a result of 13% lower iron ore reference prices. This effect
was partly offset by (i) continued progress on cost and expenses efficiency initiatives, which drove improved performance in both
Energy Transition Metals and Iron Ore segments, and (ii) the positive effect of the BRL depreciation.

Proforma EBITDA — Reporting practice

To enhance transparency and comparability, Vale reports Proforma EBITDA - a metric that provides a clearer view of
operational performance across periods. It comprises: (i) Adjusted EBITDA as defined in note 4 to Vale’s Interim Financial
Statements, which is a required disclosure under IFRS 8 — Operating Segments; excluding (ii) Brumadinho-related and dam
decharacterization effects, and (iii) non-recurring items. This metric is disclosed consistently and in compliance with CVM
Resolution 156. For the reconciliation of EBITDA Proforma to Net Income, please refer to the table on page 3.

Net Income

Proforma net income was US$ 2.1 billion in 2Q25, 6% higher y/y, positively impacted by the mark-to-market valuation of swaps,
which benefited from favorable currency variation movements over the quarter, contributing to the US$ 1.4 billion y/y increase
in financial results. This was partly offset by lower Proforma EBITDA and the negative effect from Associates & JV's, mostly
related to the Samarco provision adjustment. Net income attributable to Vale’s shareholders was USS 2.1 billion, 24% lower y/y,
since no non-recurring items were reported for 2025.

Recurring Free Cash Flow generation reached US$ 1.0 billion in 2025, USS 0.8 billion higher y/y, mainly explained by lower
working capital variation and lower capital expenditures. In the quarter, the neutral working capital was primarily attributable
to accrued sales at the quarter's end and longer sales lead times, which resulted in higher receivables and higher inventory levels,
respectively. These effects were largely offset by an increase in accounts payables, driven by the extension of supplier payment
terms. Vale’s cash position was further positively impacted by ongoing liability management initiatives, resulting in a US$ 1.5
billion increase in cash and cash equivalents during the quarter.

Gross debt and leases reached US$ 17.8 billion as of June 30", 2025, US$ 1.6 billion higher q/q, mainly as a result of the issuance
of debentures (approximately US$ 1.1 billion) and funds raised with banks (US$ 0.6 billion).

An increase in the Samarco provision was recognized in 2025 in the amount of US$ 195 million, in most part due to a revision
of the costs to complete the initiatives for the definitive compensation program (PID).

The average debt maturity decreased to 9.1 years at the end of 2025 from 9.5 years at the end of 1025. The average annual

lron Ore Solutions EBITDA was US$ 2.977 billion, 23% lower y/y, due to lower iron ore fines and pellets realized prices (US$ -
1.073 billion), impacted by the lower iron ore reference prices.

lron Ore Fines EBITDA decreased by 22% y/y, totaling US$ 2.396 billion, mostly explained by lower realized prices (US$ -901
million). This effect was partially offset by (i) lower costs and expenses (US$ 106 million), mainly due to lower C1 cash costs, (ii)
the positive effect of the BRL depreciation (US$ 99 million), and (iii) lower freight costs (US$ 44 million).

The C1 cash cost (excluding third-party purchases) reached US$ 22.2/t in Q2, US$ 2.7/t lower y/y. This is the fourth
consecutive quarter of year-over-year cost reduction. The reduction was mainly driven by: (i) higher production from sites
with lower production costs (e.g., Northern System), supporting fixed cost dilution and mix effect, (ii) lower demurrage costs,
which reached the lowest level for a Q2 since 2020, driven by efficiency initiatives such as fleet speed management and
optimization of queues and chartering processes, (iii) a positive inventory turnover effect, with the consumption of lower-cost
inventories from previous quarters, and (iv) the positive impact of the BRL depreciation. Vale remains highly confident in
achieving its 2025 C1 cash cost, excluding third-party purchases, guidance (US$ 20.5-22.0/t).

showing improved performances, supported by operational improvements, which offset lower LME prices.

Copper EBITDA increased by 53% y/y, totaling US$ 538 million, mainly driven by a robust operational performance, which is
reflected in higher fixed cost dilution (US$ 45 million), higher sales (US$ 42 million), and higher by-product revenues (US$ 90
million), boosted by gold prices. These positive effects were partially offset by lower copper realized prices (US$ -16 million).

Nickel EBITDA increased by 86% y/y, totaling US$ 201 million, largely due to increased feed availability from Voisey's Bay at
lower costs (US$ 130 million), a decrease in external feed costs (US$ 108 million), and an inventory impairment reversal (US$ 76

Revenues

Net revenues totaled USS 1.012 billion, increasing by 15% y/y, driven by stronger nickel and by-product sales volumes.

The average realized nickel price was US$ 15,800/t, down 2% q/q, explained by a 3% decrease in LME prices.

In 2Q25, the average realized nickel price was 4% higher than the LME average, mainly due to the 75% share of Upper-Class |
products in the mix of North Atlantic, with an overall positive impact of premiums of US$ 414/t.

* Excluding marketing activities. ? Includes R&D associated with current nickel operations, sales expenses and pre-operating & stoppage. ? Starting from 3024, it includes the proportionate results
from PTVI (33.9% owned by VBM). “ Considering only the cash effect of streaming transactions, nickel operations EBITDA break-even would increase to US$ 12,858/t in 2025. * Previous periods adjusted
to reflect the deconsolidation of PTVI.

All-in costs, PTVI-adjusted, totaled US$ 12,396/t, decreasing by 30% y/y and 21% q/q. The reduction was driven by lower unit
COGS and higher copper sales.

Unit COGS, excluding external feed purchases, PTVI-adjusted was US$ 22,194/t, declining by 29% y/y and 21% q/q, primarily
due to fixed cost dilution from the ramp-up of Voisey's Bay underground mines. In Sudbury, higher production and reduced
planned refinery maintenance were also supportive to the y/y improvement.

Unit COGS totaled US$ 20,743/t, down by 3% y/y and 11% q/q, in line with lower costs for own sourced and external feed.

Unit by-product revenues were USS 8,510/t, 20% higher y/y, mainly driven by sales volume.

from the purchase of ore or nickel intermediates from third parties. These transactions are valued at fair market value. * Comprises the unit COGS for Clydach and Matsusaka refineries.

Expenses were stable y/y, with unit expenses totaling US$892/t, decreasing by 20% y/y, due to higher production volumes

This press release may include statements about Vale’s current expectations about future events or results (forward-looking statements). Many of those
forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “expect,” “should,” “plan,”
“intend,” “estimate” “will” and “potential,” among others. All forward-looking statements involve various risks and uncertainties. Vale cannot guarantee
that these statements will prove correct. These risks and uncertainties include, among others, factors related to: (a) the countries where Vale operates,
especially Brazil and Canada; (b) the global economy; (c) the capital markets; (d) the mining and metals prices and their dependence on global industrial
production, which is cyclical by nature; and (e) global competition in the markets in which Vale operates. Vale cautions you that actual results may differ
materially from the plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions expressed in this presentation. Vale undertakes no obligation to publicly
update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information or future events or for any other reason. To obtain further

The information contained in this press release includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with IFRS. These non-IFRS measures
differ from the most directly comparable measures determined under IFRS, but we have not presented a reconciliation to the most directly comparable
IFRS measures, because the non-IFRS measures are forward-looking and a reconciliation cannot be prepared without unreasonable effort.

(b) Adjusted EBITDA

EBITDA defines profit or loss before interest, tax, depreciation, depletion and amortization. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA for
the Company is the operating income or loss plus EBITDA associates and joint ventures, and excluding the amounts charged as (i)
depreciation, depletion and amortization and (ii) impairment and gains (losses) on disposal of non-current assets. However, our
adjusted EBITDA is not the measure defined as EBITDA under IFRS and may possibly not be comparable with indicators with the
same name reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for operational profit or as a
better measure of liquidity than operational cash flow, which are calculated in accordance with IFRS. Vale provides its adjusted
EBITDA to give additional information about its capacity to pay debt, carry out investments and cover working capital needs. The
following tables shows the reconciliation between adjusted EBITDA and operational cash flow and adjusted EBITDA and net income,
in accordance with its statement of changes in financial position.

The definition of Adjusted EBIT is Adjusted EBITDA plus depreciation, depletion and amortization.
