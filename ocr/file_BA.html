Non-GAAP Measures Disclosures

We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in
the United States of America (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information
presented excludes certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business
operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into the company’s ongoing
business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP
measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial
statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following definitions are
provided:

Core Operating Earnings/(Loss), Core Operating Margins and Core Earnings/(Loss) Per Share

Core operating earnings/(loss) is defined as GAAP Earnings/(loss) from operations excluding the FAS/CAS service cost
adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS)
pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core operating
margins is defined as Core operating earnings/(loss) expressed as a percentage of revenue. Core earnings/(loss) per share is
defined as GAAP Diluted earnings/loss) per share excluding the net earnings/(loss) per share impact of the FAS/CAS service
cost adjustment and Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses
represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS
businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards
(CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to
government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is
generally based on benefits paid. Management uses core operating earnings/(loss), core operating margins and core earnings/
(loss) per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core
measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as they exclude non-service pension and post-
retirement costs, which primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to government contracts. A
reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided on page 12 and 13.

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is GAAP operating cash flow reduced by capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment.
Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders,
debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long
term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it
excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses free cash flow as a measure
to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. See Table 2 on page 2 for a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most
directly comparable GAAP measure, operating cash flow.


Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements

This press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “intends,” “projects,” “plans,” “believes,”
“estimates,” “targets,” “anticipates,” and other similar words or expressions, or the negative thereof, generally can
be used to help identify these forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include
statements relating to our future financial condition and operating results, industry projections and outlooks, plans,
objectives and goals, as well as any other statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact.
Forward-looking statements are based on expectations and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when
made, but that may not prove to be accurate.

These statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in circumstances that are
difficult to predict. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-
looking statements. Among these factors are risks related to: (1) general conditions in the economy and our
industry, including those due to regulatory changes; (2) our reliance on our commercial airline customers; (3) the
overall health of our aircraft production system, production quality issues, commercial airplane production rates, our
ability to successfully develop and certify new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and the ability of our aircraft to meet
stringent performance and reliability standards; (4) changing budget and appropriation levels and acquisition
priorities of the U.S. government, as well as significant delays in U.S. government appropriations; (5) our
dependence on our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as the availability of highly skilled labor and raw materials;
(6) work stoppages or other labor disruptions; (7) competition within our markets; (8) our non-U.S. operations and
sales to non-U.S. customers, including tariffs, trade restrictions and government actions; (9) changes in accounting
estimates; (10) our pending acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (Spirit), including the satisfaction of
closing conditions in the expected timeframe or at all; (11) realizing the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions,
joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures, including anticipated synergies and quality improvements related to
our pending acquisition of Spirit; (12) our dependence on U.S. government contracts; (13) our reliance on fixed-
price contracts; (14) our reliance on cost-type contracts; (15) contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments; (16)
management of a complex, global IT infrastructure; (17) compromised or unauthorized access to our, our
customers’ and/or our suppliers’ information and systems; (18) potential business disruptions, including threats to
physical security or our information technology systems, extreme weather (including effects of climate change) or
other acts of nature, and pandemics or other public health crises; (19) potential adverse developments in new or
pending litigation and/or government inquiries or investigations; (20) potential environmental liabilities; (21) effects
of climate change and legal, regulatory or market responses to such change; (22) credit rating agency actions and
our ability to effectively manage our liquidity; (23) substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations;
(24) the adequacy of our insurance coverage; (25) customer and aircraft concentration in our customer financing
portfolio; (26) the dilutive effect of future issuances of our common stock; and (27) the preferential treatment of our
6.00% mandatory convertible preferred stock.

Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in our filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q
and Current Reports on Form 8-K. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made,
and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new
information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.
