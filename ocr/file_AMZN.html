Financial Guidance

The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of July 31, 2025, and are subject to substantial
uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, tariff and trade policies, and customer demand
and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world
events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various
factors detailed below.

Third Quarter 2025 Guidance

+ Net sales are expected to be between $174.0 billion and $179.5 billion, or to grow between 10% and 13% compared
with third quarter 2024. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 130 basis points from foreign
exchange rates.

* Operating income is expected to be between $15.5 billion and $20.5 billion, compared with $17.4 billion in third
quarter 2024.

¢ This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal
settlements are concluded.

Conference Call Information
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:00 p.m. PT/5:00 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s
financial and operating results.

Forward-Looking Statements

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation,
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products,
services, and technologies, security incidents, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition,
global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give
rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial
results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent
Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
