Reconciliations of current and historical non-GAAP financial
measures to AppFolio’s financial results as determined in
accordance with GAAP are included at the end of this press release

entitled “Statement Regarding the Use of Non-GAAP Financial
Measures.”
AppFolio is unable, at this time, to provide GAAP equivalent
guidance measures on a forward-looking basis for non-GAAP
operating margin because certain items that impact this measure

such as charges related to stock-based compensation expense. The
effect of these excluded items may be significant.

Statement Regarding the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We use the following non-GAAP financial measures in addition to,
and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures
calculated in accordance with GAAP.
•  Non-GAAP presentation of income from operations, costs and
operating expenses, operating margin, net income, and net income
per share. These measures exclude certain non-cash or non-
recurring items, including stock-based compensation expense,
amortization of stock-based compensation capitalized in
software development costs, amortization of purchased
intangibles, and the related income tax effect of these
adjustments, as applicable and described below. Non-GAAP
operating margin is calculated as non-GAAP operating income
from operations as a percentage of revenue.
We use each of these non-GAAP financial measures internally to
assess and compare operating results across reporting periods, for
internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, and to evaluate our
financial performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial
measures also provide useful supplemental information to investors
and facilitate the analysis of our operating results and comparison
of operating results across reporting periods.
In particular, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are
useful to investors and others in assessing our operating
performance due to the following factors:

•  Stock-based compensation expense and amortization of stock-
based compensation capitalized in software development costs.
We utilize stock-based compensation to attract and retain
employees. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests
with those of our stockholders while ensuring long-term
retention, rather than to address operational performance for
any particular period. As a result, stock-based compensation
expenses vary for reasons that are generally unrelated to
financial and operational performance in any particular
period.
•  Amortization of purchased intangibles. We view amortization of
purchased intangible assets as items arising from pre-
acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition.
While these intangible assets are evaluated for impairment
regularly, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is
an expense that is not typically affected by operations during
any particular period.
•  Income tax effects of adjustments. We utilize a fixed long-term
projected tax rate in our computation of non-GAAP income
tax effects to provide better consistency across interim
reporting periods. In projecting this long-term non-GAAP tax
rate, we utilize a financial projection that excludes the direct
impact of other non-GAAP adjustments. The projected rate,
which we have determined to be 21% and 25% for 2025 and
2024, respectively, considers other factors such as our current
operating structure, existing tax positions in various
jurisdictions, and key legislation in major jurisdictions where
we operate. We periodically re-evaluate this tax rate, as
necessary, for significant events, based on relevant tax law
changes, and material changes in the forecasted geographic
earnings mix.
Our non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that
is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our
industry, as other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial
results differently. In addition, there are limitations in using non-
GAAP financial measures because non-GAAP financial measures are
not prepared in accordance with GAAP and can exclude expenses

that may have a material impact on our reported financial results.
As such, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in
isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared
in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the historical non-
GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP
measures has been provided in the tables above. We encourage
investors to review the reconciliation of these historical non-GAAP
financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP
financial measures.
