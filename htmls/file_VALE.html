“We delivered another strong quarter, reflecting our focus on operational excellence and disciplined execution, keeping 
us on track to meet our 2025 guidances. Safety remains a core value, and we’re encouraged by the clear progress toward 
an accident-free work environment across our operations. As we advance in our strategy to strengthen our flexible 
product portfolio, we continue to lower costs and build resilience, which will help us navigate well in any market scenario. 
This quarter, we also reached a key milestone as our first copper mine project under the New Carajás program obtained 
its preliminary license, marking tangible progress toward future growth. These achievements reaffirm our strategy and 
demonstrate our commitment to building a leading mining platform that creates long-term value for all stakeholders.", 
commented Gustavo Pimenta, Chief Executive Officer. 
Results Highlights 
• 
Operational and cost performance improved across all business segments; all guidances on track. Copper and nickel 
sales increased 17% (12.9 kt) and 21% (7.0 kt) y/y, respectively. Iron ore shipments declined 3% (2.4 Mt) y/y, reflecting the 
ongoing portfolio optimization strategy. 
• 
The average realized iron ore fines price was US$ 85.1/t, 6% lower q/q and 13% lower y/y, in line with the broader decline 
in iron ore reference prices. 
• 
Iron ore fines’ C1 cash cost, excluding third-party purchases, decreased by 11% y/y, reaching US$ 22.2/t, marking the 
fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year cost reduction.  
• 
All-in costs were down 10% in iron ore (US$ 55.3/t), 60% in copper (US$ 1,450/t), and 30% in nickel (US$ 12,396/t) y/y, 
as a result of the implementation of efficiency initiatives and higher production. 
• 
Copper all-in cost guidance for 2025 revised down to US$ 1,500-2,000/t (from US$ 2,800-3,300/t), driven by solid 
operational performance and higher-than-expected gold prices. 
• 
Proforma EBITDA totaled US$ 3.4 billion, 7% higher q/q and 14% lower y/y.  The strong performance of copper and 
nickel segments, along with lower C1 cash cost in iron ore, partly offset the impact of weaker commodity prices. 
• 
Capital expenditures of US$ 1.1 billion were US$ 0.2 billion lower y/y, on track to meet the 2025 guidance of US$ 5.9 
billion and reflecting ongoing efficiency initiatives. 
• 
Recurring free cash flow generation was US$ 1.0 billion, US$ 0.8 billion higher y/y, as a result of more favorable working 
capital variation and lower capital expenditures. 
• 
Expanded net debt of US$ 17.4 billion as of June 30th was US$ 0.8 billion lower q/q, mainly driven by free cash flow 
generation. 
• 
Approval of US$ 1.448 billion in interest on capital to be paid in September 2025, implying an annualized yield of 7%1.

Business 
Highlights 
 
Iron Ore Solutions 
• The first shipment of the Capanema project was completed in Q2. The project will add 15 Mtpy of 
net iron ore capacity, with ramp-up completion expected in the first half of 2026. This expansion will 
support the company’s production guidance for 2025 (325-335 Mt). 
Energy Transition Metals 
• Vale Base Metals obtained the Preliminary License for the Bacaba project in June. The project is 
designed to extend the life of the Sossego Mining Complex, contributing with an average annual copper 
production of around 50 ktpy over an 8-year mine life. Approximately US$ 290 million will be invested 
during the project’s implementation phase, and the production start-up is planned for the 1H28. 
• Commissioning of the Onça Puma's 2nd furnace project began in July. Supported by a planned 
investment of US$ 555 million, the project is expected to contribute to cost reduction across the 
complex and increase nickel production capacity by 12–15 ktpy. With 94% of physical progress 
completed, initial metal production is anticipated in 4Q25. 
ESG 
 
Tailing Dams 
• The Grupo dam was removed from emergency level in May, following a stability declaration. In 
July, the Xingu dam’s emergency level was lowered from 2 to 1 after improved monitoring and 
structural evaluations. Grupo dam is expected to be fully decharacterized by late 2025, and Xingu dam 
by 2034. Vale's ongoing Decharacterization Program has decharacterized 17 of 30 upstream dams since 
2019.  
   Circular Mining 
• Vale's Waste-to-Value program continues to advance, transforming waste and tailings into valuable 
resources. The program currently encompasses 150 initiatives, including the tailings reprocessing 
operation in Gelado and Vargem Grande dams and the WH wastepile in Capanema. In the 1H25, Vale 
produced around 9 Mt from circularity sources, 14% higher than the same period in 2024. 
Forest protection 
• Vale has achieved 200,000 hectares of forest conserved, representing 50% of its 2030 voluntary 
target. The company currently supports forest protection efforts across 1 million hectares worldwide, 
including 800,000 hectares in the Amazon in collaboration with ICMBio.  
Transparency 
• Vale published its sustainability-related financial disclosures report, available here, marking a 
significant step in alignment with international ISSB standards and Brazilian CBPS Sustainability 
Disclosure Pronouncements. The voluntary disclosure anticipates regulatory requirements under CVM 
Resolution 193/23 by two years, underscoring Vale’s commitment to transparency and the continued 
evolution of its climate and sustainability reporting practices. 
Reparation 
 
Brumadinho 
• The Brumadinho Integral Reparation Agreement continues to progress, with approximately 77% of 
the agreed-upon commitments completed by 2Q25 and in accordance with the deadlines outlined in 
the settlement. In addition, R$ 3.9 billion has been paid in individual compensation since 2019.  
Mariana 
• The Samarco reparation program continues to progress, with R$ 60 billion disbursed as of June 30, 
2025. The definitive compensation program (PID) exceeded initial expectations with formal adherence 
from over 290,000 individuals. This strong level of engagement reflects the success of the agreement 
and highlights the effectiveness in resolving the underlying claims through a transparent and 
structured process.

EBITDA 
 
Proforma EBITDA was US$ 3.4 billion in 2Q25, 14% lower y/y, mainly as a result of 13% lower iron ore reference prices. This effect 
was partly offset by (i) continued progress on cost and expenses efficiency initiatives, which drove improved performance in both 
Energy Transition Metals and Iron Ore segments, and (ii) the positive effect of the BRL depreciation.  
Proforma EBITDA 2Q25 vs. 2Q24 - US$ million  
 
1 Excluding Brumadinho expenses. 2Q24 Proforma EBITDA was restated excluding one-off events (US$ 5 million). 2 Including volume, EBITDA from associates and JV’s and others. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Net Income 
Proforma net income was US$ 2.1 billion in 2Q25, 6% higher y/y, positively impacted by the mark-to-market valuation of swaps, 
which benefited from favorable currency variation movements over the quarter, contributing to the US$ 1.4 billion y/y increase 
in financial results. This was partly offset by lower Proforma EBITDA and the negative effect from Associates & JV's, mostly 
related to the Samarco provision adjustment. Net income attributable to Vale’s shareholders was US$ 2.1 billion, 24% lower y/y, 
since no non-recurring items were reported for 2Q25. 
Proforma net income 2Q25 vs. 2Q24 – US$ million 
 
1 Excluding US$ 282 million in taxes related to non-recurring items. 2 Including variations of (i) US$ -180 million in equity results and (ii) US$ -49 million in EBITDA from associates and JV’s. 3 Excluding US$ 
1.06 billion related to gains on divestment of PTVI in 2Q24. ⁴ Including a variation of US$ 1.01 billion in currency and interest rate swaps. 5 Including variations of (i) US$ -38 million in Brumadinho and 
decharacterization of dams, (ii) US$ -18 million in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and (iii) US$ 13 million in depreciation, depletion & amortization. 
Proforma EBITDA – Reporting practice 
To enhance transparency and comparability, Vale reports Proforma EBITDA - a metric that provides a clearer view of 
operational performance across periods. It comprises: (i) Adjusted EBITDA as defined in note 4 to Vale’s Interim Financial 
Statements, which is a required disclosure under IFRS 8 – Operating Segments; excluding (ii) Brumadinho-related and dam 
decharacterization effects, and (iii) non-recurring items. This metric is disclosed consistently and in compliance with CVM 
Resolution 156. For the reconciliation of EBITDA Proforma to Net Income, please refer to the table on page 3.

Investments in growth projects totaled US$ 238 million, US$ 90 million (-27%) lower y/y, mainly as a result of lower 
disbursements in the Iron Ore Solutions segment as the Capanema project ramps up and lower expenditures in the Serra Sul+20 
project, which is being carried out according to schedule. The Onça Puma 2nd Furnace project is on schedule for first production 
in 4Q25. Once fully operational, the project will add 12-15 ktpy of nickel production capacity.

Sustaining investments totaled US$ 815 million, US$ 185 million (-19%) lower y/y, mainly as a result of lower expenditures in 
the Nickel segment with the commissioning of the Voisey´s Bay Mine Expansion (VBME) project. The Bacaba copper project was 
granted the Preliminary License in June. The project is designed to extend the life of the Sossego Mining Complex, contributing 
with an average annual copper production of approximately 50 ktpy over an 8-year mine life. Approximately US$ 290 million will 
be invested during the project's implementation phase, and the production start-up is planned for 1H28.

¹ Excluding expenses related to Brumadinho and non-recurring items. Previous periods were restated. ² Includes US$ -66 million related to streaming transactions in 2Q25, US$ -37 million in 2Q24, US$ -51 million 
in 1Q25, US$ -117 million in 6M25 and US$ -74 million in 6M24, reflecting the difference between contractual terms and cash receipts, subject to volume and settlement dynamics. ³ Includes interest in loans and 
borrowings, leasing and net cash received on settlement of derivatives. ⁴ Net of US$ 61 million in dividends received in 2Q25, US$ 39 million in 2Q24, US$ 19 million in 1Q25, US$ 80 million in 6M25 and US$ 42 
million in 6M24. ⁵ Includes payments related to dam decharacterization, incurred expenses related to Brumadinho, and others. 
Recurring Free Cash Flow generation reached US$ 1.0 billion in 2Q25, US$ 0.8 billion higher y/y, mainly explained by lower 
working capital variation and lower capital expenditures. In the quarter, the neutral working capital was primarily attributable 
to accrued sales at the quarter's end and longer sales lead times, which resulted in higher receivables and higher inventory levels, 
respectively. These effects were largely offset by an increase in accounts payables, driven by the extension of supplier payment 
terms. Vale’s cash position was further positively impacted by ongoing liability management initiatives, resulting in a US$ 1.5 
billion increase in cash and cash equivalents during the quarter.  
 
Free Cash Flow 2Q25 - US$ million 
¹Includes income taxes and REFIS (US$ -468 million), interests on loans and borrowings (US$ -269 million), leasing (US$ -33 million), net cash received on settlement of derivatives (US$ 149 million), and

1 Does not include leases (IFRS 16). 2 Includes interest rate swaps.  
 
Expanded net debt reduced by US$ 0.8 billion q/q, totaling US$ 17.4 billion, with the higher free cash flow generation q/q 
positively impacting our cash position. Vale's expanded net debt target remains at US$ 10-20 billion.    
Gross debt and leases reached US$ 17.8 billion as of June 30th, 2025, US$ 1.6 billion higher q/q, mainly as a result of the issuance 
of debentures (approximately US$ 1.1 billion) and funds raised with banks (US$ 0.6 billion).  
An increase in the Samarco provision was recognized in 2Q25 in the amount of US$ 195 million, in most part due to a revision 
of the costs to complete the initiatives for the definitive compensation program (PID). 
The average debt maturity decreased to 9.1 years at the end of 2Q25 from 9.5 years at the end of 1Q25. The average annual 
cost of debt after currency and interest rate swaps was 5.5%, unchanged from the end of 1Q25.

Iron Ore Solutions EBITDA was US$ 2.977 billion, 23% lower y/y, due to lower iron ore fines and pellets realized prices (US$ -
1.073 billion), impacted by the lower iron ore reference prices. 
 
Iron Ore Fines EBITDA decreased by 22% y/y, totaling US$ 2.396 billion, mostly explained by lower realized prices (US$ -901 
million). This effect was partially offset by (i) lower costs and expenses (US$ 106 million), mainly due to lower C1 cash costs, (ii) 
the positive effect of the BRL depreciation (US$ 99 million), and (iii) lower freight costs (US$ 44 million). 
Iron Ore Pellets EBITDA decreased by 34% y/y, totaling US$ 477 million, mostly explained by lower realized prices (US$ -172 
million) and lower volumes (US$ -113 million). These effects were partly offset by the positive effect of the BRL depreciation (US$ 
37 million).

The all-in premium decreased by US$ 0.7/t q/q, totaling US$ 1.1/t, mainly driven by lower contribution of the pellet business 
(US$ 0.9/t lower q/q), due to the lower share in the sales mix. This effect was partly offset by higher iron ore fines premiums (US$ 
0.2/t higher q/q), as a result of the product portfolio optimization strategy.

The C1 cash cost (excluding third-party purchases) reached US$ 22.2/t in Q2, US$ 2.7/t lower y/y. This is the fourth 
consecutive quarter of year-over-year cost reduction. The reduction was mainly driven by: (i) higher production from sites 
with lower production costs (e.g., Northern System), supporting fixed cost dilution and mix effect, (ii) lower demurrage costs, 
which reached the lowest level for a Q2 since 2020, driven by efficiency initiatives such as fleet speed management and 
optimization of queues and chartering processes, (iii) a positive inventory turnover effect, with the consumption of lower-cost 
inventories from previous quarters, and (iv) the positive impact of the BRL depreciation. Vale remains highly confident in 
achieving its 2025 C1 cash cost, excluding third-party purchases, guidance (US$ 20.5−22.0/t).

Vale's maritime freight cost averaged US$ 18.3/t, US$ 0.3/t lower q/q, mostly driven by lower bunker fuel costs. CFR sales totaled 59.8 
Mt in Q2, representing 88% of total iron ore fines sales.

Energy Transition Metals EBITDA increased by 77% y/y, totaling US$ 721 million, with both Copper and Nickel businesses 
showing improved performances, supported by operational improvements, which offset lower LME prices. 
Copper EBITDA increased by 53% y/y, totaling US$ 538 million, mainly driven by a robust operational performance, which is 
reflected in higher fixed cost dilution (US$ 45 million), higher sales (US$ 42 million), and higher by-product revenues (US$ 90 
million), boosted by gold prices. These positive effects were partially offset by lower copper realized prices (US$ -16 million). 
Nickel EBITDA increased by 86% y/y, totaling US$ 201 million, largely due to increased feed availability from Voisey's Bay at 
lower costs (US$ 130 million), a decrease in external feed costs (US$ 108 million), and an inventory impairment reversal (US$ 76 
million). These positive effects were partially offset by lower realized nickel prices (US$ -134 million) and the PTVI deconsolidation 
(US$ -108 million). 
 
EBITDA variation – US$ million (2Q25 vs. 2Q24) 
 
1 Includes adjustment of US$ 168 million in 2Q25 and US$ 83 million in 2Q24 to reflect the performance of the streaming transactions at market price, which will be made until the proceeds received on 
the streaming transactions are fully recognized in the adjusted EBITDA of the business. Based on the current projections for volumes and commodities prices, it will be fully realized by 2027. ² Includes 
variations of (i) US$ -150 million in realized prices for copper and nickel, (ii) US$ 108 million in realized prices for by-products and (iii) US$ 11 million in PPA. ³ Includes variations of (i) US$ 143 million costs 
improvements of Voisey's Bay (US$ 130 million) and Sudbury (US$ 13 million) and (ii) US$ 108 million in lower cost of external feed due to the impact of LME prices in Refineries operation. ⁴ Including a 
variation of US$ 115 million in by-product volumes.

Revenues  
Net revenues totaled US$ 958 million, 23% higher y/y, mainly due to higher copper sales and increased by-product revenues. 
Higher by-product revenues resulted from higher gold prices (US$ 88 million) and an increase in gold sales (US$ 22 million).  
The average realized copper price was US$ 8,985/t, 1% higher q/q, driven by a higher average LME copper price and lower spot 
TC/RC discounts, offsetting timing effects. 
Average realized copper price 2Q25 – US$/t 
 
Note: Vale’s copper products are sold on a provisional pricing basis, with final prices determined in a future period. The average copper realized price excludes the mark-to-market of open invoices based 
on the copper price forward curve (unrealized provisional price adjustments) and includes the prior and current period price adjustments (realized provisional price adjustments). 1 Current-period price 
adjustments: Final invoices that were provisionally priced and settled within the quarter. 2 Prior-period price adjustment: Final invoices of sales provisionally priced in prior quarters. 3 TC/RCs, penalties, 
premiums, and discounts for intermediate products.

1 Includes sales expenses, R&D associated with Salobo and Sossego, pre-operating and stoppage expenses and other expenses. 2 Considering only the cash effect of streaming transactions, copper 
operations EBITDA break-even would increase to US$ 4,702/t in 2Q25. 3 The realized price to be compared to the EBITDA break-even should be the copper realized price before discounts (US$ 9,203/t 
for 2Q25 and US$ 9,190/t for 6M25), given that TC/RCs, penalties, and other discounts are already part of the EBITDA break-even build-up.  
 
All-in costs were US$ 1,450/t, 60% lower y/y, driven by (i) higher by-product revenues, (ii) lower unit COGS and (iii) lower TC/RCs, 
and other discounts. Guidance for 2025 was revised down to US$ 1,500-2,000/t (from US$ 2,800-3,300/t). 
Unit COGS was US$ 6,057/t, down by 10% y/y, due to higher fixed cost dilution at Salobo and Sossego following the full ramp-
up of the Salobo complex and increased copper feed grade and plant availability at Sossego. 
Unit COGS, net of by-products, totaled US$ 1,095/t, declining by 64% y/y, mainly reflecting the positive impact of by-product 
revenues at both Salobo and Sossego, following higher gold prices.

Revenues 
Net revenues totaled US$ 1.012 billion, increasing by 15% y/y, driven by stronger nickel and by-product sales volumes. 
The average realized nickel price was US$ 15,800/t, down 2% q/q, explained by a 3% decrease in LME prices.  
In 2Q25, the average realized nickel price was 4% higher than the LME average, mainly due to the 75% share of Upper-Class I 
products in the mix of North Atlantic, with an overall positive impact of premiums of US$ 414/t.

1 Excluding marketing activities. 2 Includes R&D associated with current nickel operations, sales expenses and pre-operating & stoppage. 3 Starting from 3Q24, it includes the proportionate results 
from PTVI (33.9% owned by VBM). 4 Considering only the cash effect of streaming transactions, nickel operations EBITDA break-even would increase to US$ 12,858/t in 2Q25. 5 Previous periods adjusted 
to reflect the deconsolidation of PTVI. 
 
All-in costs, PTVI-adjusted, totaled US$ 12,396/t, decreasing by 30% y/y and 21% q/q. The reduction was driven by lower unit 
COGS and higher copper sales. 
Unit COGS, excluding external feed purchases, PTVI-adjusted was US$ 22,194/t, declining by 29% y/y and 21% q/q, primarily 
due to fixed cost dilution from the ramp-up of Voisey's Bay underground mines. In Sudbury, higher production and reduced 
planned refinery maintenance were also supportive to the y/y improvement. 
Unit COGS totaled US$ 20,743/t, down by 3% y/y and 11% q/q, in line with lower costs for own sourced and external feed.  
Unit by-product revenues were US$ 8,510/t, 20% higher y/y, mainly driven by sales volume.

¹ Sudbury costs include Thompson costs. ² A large portion of Sudbury, Clydach, Matsusaka and Long Harbour finished nickel production is derived from intercompany transfers, as well as 
from the purchase of ore or nickel intermediates from third parties. These transactions are valued at fair market value. ³ Comprises the unit COGS for Clydach and Matsusaka refineries. 
Expenses were stable y/y, with unit expenses totaling US$892/t, decreasing by 20% y/y, due to higher production volumes 
diluting unit expenses.

that these statements will prove correct. These risks and uncertainties include, among others, factors related to: (a) the countries where Vale operates, 
especially Brazil and Canada; (b) the global economy; (c) the capital markets; (d) the mining and metals prices and their dependence on global industrial 
production, which is cyclical by nature; and (e) global competition in the markets in which Vale operates. Vale cautions you that actual results may differ

(b) Adjusted EBITDA 
EBITDA defines profit or loss before interest, tax, depreciation, depletion and amortization. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA for 
the Company is the operating income or loss plus EBITDA associates and joint ventures, and excluding the amounts charged as (i) 
depreciation, depletion and amortization and (ii) impairment and gains (losses) on disposal of non-current assets. However, our 
adjusted EBITDA is not the measure defined as EBITDA under IFRS and may possibly not be comparable with indicators with the 
same name reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for operational profit or as a 
better measure of liquidity than operational cash flow, which are calculated in accordance with IFRS. Vale provides its adjusted 
EBITDA to give additional information about its capacity to pay debt, carry out investments and cover working capital needs. The 
following tables shows the reconciliation between adjusted EBITDA and operational cash flow and adjusted EBITDA and net income, 
in accordance with its statement of changes in financial position. 
The definition of Adjusted EBIT is Adjusted EBITDA plus depreciation, depletion and amortization.
