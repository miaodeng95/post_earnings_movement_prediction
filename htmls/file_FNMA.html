Fannie Mae Reports Second Quarter 2025 Results
Quarterly Highlights
“Fannie Mae gets stronger by the day: We have achieved 
$100 billion in company net worth and our focus on 
operational efficiency has driven down administrative 
expenses 15% since the first quarter, with a total savings of 
$256 million in non-interest expenses. We will continue 
operating the company as a for-profit enterprise so that we 
can drive down housing costs and deliver maximum value 
for the American people.” 
- William J. Pulte, Director U.S. Federal Housing and 
Chairman, Fannie Mae Board of Directors
“Fannie Mae had another solid quarter, reporting $3.3 billion 
of net income. Net revenues were steady, and we kept our 
focus on building regulatory capital and achieving attractive 
returns. This quarter’s notable progress on expenses was 
greatly aided by the efficiency and deregulation efforts of 
Director Pulte and the entire team at U.S. Federal Housing. 
We remain steadfast in our mission, and in safely and 
soundly making a positive impact on American housing.” 
- Priscilla Almodovar, President and Chief Executive

Single-Family Key Business Second Quarter Highlights 
• Single-family conventional acquisition volume was $84.1 billion, compared with $85.9 billion in the second 
quarter of 2024. Purchase acquisition volume, of which approximately half was for first-time homebuyers, 
decreased to $64.3 billion, from $74.5 billion in the second quarter of 2024. Refinance acquisition volume was 
$19.8 billion, an increase from $11.4 billion in the second quarter of 2024. 
• The average single-family conventional guaranty book of business decreased by $27.8 billion compared with the 
second quarter of 2024, to $3.6 trillion. The overall credit characteristics of the single-family conventional 
guaranty book of business remained strong, with a weighted-average mark-to-market loan-to-value ratio of 50% 
and a weighted-average FICO credit score at origination of 753 as of June 30, 2025.
• The single-family serious delinquency rate decreased to 0.53% as of June 30, 2025 from 0.56% as of March 31, 
2025. Single-family seriously delinquent loans are loans that are 90 days or more past due or in the foreclosure 
process. Our single-family serious delinquency rate is expressed as a percentage of our single-family 
conventional guaranty book of business based on loan count. 
• The single-family provision for credit losses was $737 million, primarily driven by lower actual and forecasted 
home price growth.
• The average charged guaranty fee, net of TCCA fees, on the single-family conventional guaranty book 
increased to 48.3 basis points in the second quarter of 2025, compared with 47.6 basis points in the second 
quarter of 2024. The average charged guaranty fee on newly acquired single-family conventional loans, net of 
TCCA fees, increased to 57.3 basis points in the second quarter of 2025, compared with 51.9 basis points in the 
second quarter of 2024, primarily as a result of a shift in the profile of loans we acquired to loans with higher 
upfront fees, as well as higher base guaranty fees on new single-family loan acquisitions.

to 73.3 basis points as of June 30, 2025, compared with 75.5 basis points as of June 30, 2024.
• The multifamily serious delinquency rate decreased to 0.61% as of June 30, 2025 from 0.63% as of March 31, 
2025. Multifamily serious delinquency rate consists of multifamily loans that were 60 days or more past due 
based on unpaid principal balance, expressed as a percentage of our multifamily guaranty book of business.
• The multifamily provision for credit losses of $209 million in the second quarter of 2025 was primarily driven by 
declines in actual and estimated near-term projected multifamily property values and new delinquencies during 
the second quarter.
