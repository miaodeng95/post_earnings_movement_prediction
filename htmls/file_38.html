$0.6 million, or 39%, from the fiscal 2024 second quarter

Non-GAAP Gross Profit of $1.6 million. The difference
between GAAP and Non-GAAP Gross Profit is limited to non-
cash stock-based compensation and depreciation and
amortization expenses that are excluded from the Non-GAAP
Gross Profit.
•  Non-GAAP Gross Margin2: Non-GAAP Gross Margin for the
second quarter of fiscal 2025 was 71.8%, a decrease of 1.3%
from the fiscal 2024 second quarter Non-GAAP Gross Margin

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the financial information presented in accordance
with GAAP, we use non-GAAP measures of certain components of
financial performance. Each of Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Non-GAAP
Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA Loss, Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted
Net Loss per Share and Non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Expenses is a
financial measure that is not required by or presented in accordance
with GAAP. Management believes that each measure provides
investors an additional meaningful method to evaluate certain
aspects of such results period over period. The Company defines
each of its non-GAAP financial measures as follows:
•  Non-GAAP Gross Profit is defined as GAAP gross profit less
non-cash stock-based compensation expense and depreciation
and amortization expense. We use Non-GAAP Gross Profit to
measure, understand and evaluate our core operating
performance and trends and to develop short-term and long-
term operating plans.
•  Non-GAAP Gross Margin is defined as GAAP gross margin less
non-cash stock-based compensation expense. We use Non-
GAAP Gross Margin to measure, understand and evaluate our
core business performance.
•  Adjusted EBITDA Loss is defined as net loss before interest
expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and
amortization expense, stock-based compensation,
remeasurements of liability-classified warrants, and other
non-recurring non-operating income and expenses. We use
Adjusted EBITDA Loss to measure the operating performance
of our business, excluding specifically identified items that we
do not believe directly reflect our core operations and may
not be indicative of our recurring operations.
•  Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss per Share are
defined as net loss and net loss per share excluding the
impact of the non-cash, non-operating charges associated
with the remeasurement of the Company’s warrant liability.
•  Non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Expenses is defined as
operating expenses before depreciation and amortization

expense, non-recurring one-time expenses and non-cash stock-
based compensation expense. We use Non-GAAP Adjusted
Operating expenses to measure our operating expenses,
excluding items we do not believe directly reflect our core
operations. 
The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial results
prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our presentation of non-
GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by
other companies. For a reconciliation of each of Non-GAAP Gross
Profit, Non-GAAP Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA Loss, Adjusted
Net Loss, Adjusted Net Loss per Share and Non-GAAP Adjusted
Operating Expenses to its most directly comparable GAAP measure,
please refer to the reconciliations below.
