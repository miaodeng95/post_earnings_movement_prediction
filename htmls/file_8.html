up 34% from the prior year to 11.7 million. The company added a record 1.26 million new products, up 
34% from the prior year to 17.1 million products.
•
Delivering Results by Serving Members’ Full Financial Needs. SoFi's integrated one-stop shop financial 
services model drove consistent member acquisition and product adoption, with 35% of new products 
1

opened by existing members. This strategy boosted Financial Services revenue per product by over 50% 
year-over-year in the second quarter. Products like SoFi Relay, which provides members with fully 
integrated financial insights; SoFi Money, which offers industry-leading 3.8% APY; and SoFi Invest, which 
provides expansion of alternative investment opportunities, deliver tangible value and competitive benefits 
that are seamlessly integrated on SoFi’s one-stop shop financial services platform.
•
Demonstrating Successful Diversification and Durable Growth with Record Fee-Based Revenue. 
Total fee-based revenue reached a record of $377.5 million, up 72% from the prior year period, driven by 
strong performance from SoFi’s Loan Platform Business (LPB), origination fees, referral fees, interchange 
revenue and brokerage fee revenue. LPB originated $2.4 billion in loans on behalf of third parties in the 
second quarter, an increase of 57% from the first quarter, and is now running at an annualized pace of over 
$9.5 billion in originations and half a billion dollars in high-margin, high-return fee-based revenue, and 
moved closer to the goal of becoming a billion-dollar revenue business for SoFi.
•
Loan Originations Reach Record-Highs with Expanded Product Innovation. SoFi originated a record 
$8.8 billion in loans during the quarter, including LPB originations. With enhanced technology and 
improved fulfillment capabilities, SoFi launched a new personal loan product for prime credit card 
customers. Personal loan originations were up 66% year-over-year. Student loan originations were up 35% 
from a year ago with a new flexible student loan refinancing option. With stronger technology, improved 
fulfillment capabilities, and a recent home equity offering, SoFi home loan originations increased by 92% 
year-over-year.
•
Transforming the Future of Finance with Crypto and AI Technology. SoFi announced plans to launch 
blockchain-enabled international money transfers and a return to crypto investing. Also, strategic 
investments and innovations in AI, with upcoming features like "Cash Coach", will give even more 
members tools to optimize their finances. 
•
Strengthened Brand Awareness to Attract More Members to SoFi’s Ecosystem. With continued 
investment to build SoFi into a trusted household name, unaided brand awareness accelerated to an all-time 
high of 8.5%.
•
Further Improved Credit Performance. SoFi’s annualized charge-off rate decreased from 3.31% to 
2.83% for personal loans compared to the first quarter. The on-balance sheet 90-day delinquency rate for 
personal loans decreased for the fifth consecutive quarter to 0.42%.
Consolidated Results
SoFi reported a number of key financial achievements. For the second quarter of 2025, GAAP net revenue of 
$854.9 million increased 43% relative to the prior-year period's $598.6 million. Record adjusted net revenue of 
$858.2 million grew 44% from the corresponding prior-year period of $597.0 million.
For the second quarter of 2025, total fee-based revenue reached a record of $377.5 million, a year-over-year 
increase of 72%. This was driven by strong performance from our Loan Platform Business, as well as origination 
fee revenue, referral fee revenue, interchange fee revenue and brokerage fee revenue. Together, the Financial 
Services and Technology Platform segments generated $472.4 million of net revenue, an increase of 74% from the 
prior year period. 
SoFi reported its seventh consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. For the second quarter of 2025, GAAP net 
income reached $97.3 million and diluted earnings per share reached $0.08.
Second quarter record adjusted EBITDA of $249.1 million increased 81% from the prior year period's $137.9 
million. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 29%. All three segments delivered strong contribution 
profit, at attractive margins.

Equity grew by $182.1 million during the quarter, ending at $6.9 billion and $6.16 of book value per share. 
Tangible book value grew by $193.8 million during the quarter, ending the period at $5.3 billion. Tangible book 
value per share was $4.72 at quarter-end, up from $3.94 per share in the prior year period.
Net interest income of $517.8 million for the second quarter was up 26% year-over-year. This was driven by a 24% 
increase in average interest-earning assets and a 77 basis point decrease in cost of funds, partially offset by a 56 
basis point decrease in average asset yields year-over-year.  For the second quarter, net interest margin of 5.86% 
increased 3 basis points year-over-year from 5.83%.
The average rate on deposits in the second quarter was 187 basis points lower than that of warehouse facilities, 
which translates to approximately $551.9 million of annualized interest expense savings due to the successful 
remixing of our funding base.
Member and Product Growth
Continued growth in both total members and products in the second quarter is the result of our continued 
investments in innovation and brand building and reflects the benefits of our broad product suite and unique 
Financial Services Productivity Loop (FSPL) strategy. 
Added a record 850,000 members in the second quarter of 2025, bringing total members over 11.7 million, up 34% 
from 8.8 million at the end of the  same prior year period. 
Record product additions of 1.26 million in the second quarter of 2025, bringing total products to over 17.1 million, 
up 34% from 12.8 million at the end of the same prior year period.

The company includes SoFi accounts on the Galileo platform-as-a-service in its total Technology Platform accounts metric to better align with the 
presentation of Technology Platform segment revenue.
Financial Services products increased by 35% year-over-year to 14.9 million, primarily driven by continued demand 
for our SoFi Money, Relay and Invest products, and drove 89% of our total product growth. SoFi Money and SoFi 
Relay grew to 5.9 million and 5.5 million products, respectively, both representing nearly 40% year-over-year 
growth. 
Lending products increased by 28% year-over-year to 2.3 million products, driven primarily by continued demand 
for personal, student and home loan products. 
Technology Platform enabled accounts increased 1% year-over-year to 160 million.
Financial Services Segment Results
For the second quarter of 2025, Financial Services segment net revenue of $362.5 million more than doubled from 
the prior year period. Net interest income of $193.3 million increased 39% year-over-year, primarily driven by 
growth in consumer deposits. Noninterest income of $169.2 million more than quadrupled year-over-year, and now 
represents nearly $680 million in annualized revenue.
In the second quarter, SoFi's Loan Platform Business added $130.6 million to our consolidated adjusted net revenue. 
Of this, $127.4 million was driven by $2.4 billion of personal loans originated on behalf of third parties as well as 
referrals to third parties. 
In addition to our Loan Platform Business, SoFi continued to see healthy growth in interchange fee revenue in the 
second quarter, up 83% year-over-year, as a result of nearly $18 billion in total annualized spend in the quarter 
across Money and Credit Card.
Contribution profit for the second quarter of 2025 reached $188.2 million, a $133.0 million improvement from the 
prior year period, while contribution margin grew 21 percentage points year-over-year to 52%. This is a reflection 
of the strong operating leverage generated in the segment, with directly attributable expenses increasing only 50%.

___________________
(1) 
During the three months ended June 30, 2025, the cumulative fair value adjustments for personal loans were impacted by a higher unpaid principal 
balance, a lower weighted average discount rate and a lower weighted average annual default rate, and a lower weighted average conditional prepayment 
rate, partially offset by a lower weighted average coupon. The lower discount rate was driven by a 25 basis points decrease in benchmark rates offset by 5 
basis points of spread widening. The cumulative fair value adjustments for student loans were impacted by a higher unpaid principal balance and a lower 
weighted average discount rate partially offset by lower weighted average coupon and higher weighted average conditional prepayment rate. The lower 
discount rate was driven by a 27 basis points decrease in benchmark rates partially offset by 2 basis points of spread widening. 
(2) 
Each component of the fair value of loans is impacted by charge-offs during the period. Our fair value assumption for annual default rate incorporates fair 
value markdowns on loans beginning when they are 10 days or more delinquent, with additional markdowns at 30, 60 and 90 days past due.
(3) 
Student loans are classified as loans held for investment, and personal loans and home loans are classified as loans held for sale.

For the second quarter of 2025, record origination volume of $8.8 billion increased 64% year-over-year. This was a 
result of continued strong member demand for personal loans, student loans and home loans as well as strong 
demand from capital markets partners.
Record personal loan originations of $7.0 billion in the second quarter of 2025 were up 66% year-over-year, 
inclusive of $2.4 billion originated on behalf of third parties through our Loan Platform Business. Second quarter 
student loan volume of $1.0 billion was up 35% year-over-year. Home equity loan originations were a record during 
the second quarter, accounting for nearly one-third of total home loan volume. In total, home loan volume was $799 
million, an increase of 92% year-over-year. 
Capital markets activity in the second quarter of 2025 was very strong. Overall, SoFi sold, or transferred through 
our Loan Platform Business, more than $3.4 billion in total of personal loans and home loans. In terms of personal 
loans, we closed $200.0 million of sales in whole loan form at a blended execution of 105.8%. In terms of home 
loan sales, we closed $777 million at a blended execution of 102.2%.
In addition to our personal and home loan sales, SoFi executed a $690 million co-contributor securitization of loans 
previously originated through our Loan Platform Business. This was the second securitization of new collateral in 
our SoFi Consumer Loan Program (SCLP) since 2021 using collateral originated in the Loan Platform Business. 
Importantly, this channel provides our partners with meaningful liquidity to support their ongoing investment in the 
Loan Platform Business. The transaction priced at industry-leading cost-of-funds levels, with a weighted average 
spread of 101 basis points.
Credit performance further strengthened in the second quarter. The on-balance sheet 90 day delinquency rate for 
personal loans decreased from 46 basis points to 42 basis points, while the on-balance sheet 90 day delinquency rate 
for student loans was 13 basis points, in line with the prior quarter.
Personal loan annualized charge-off rate decreased to 2.83% from 3.31% in the prior quarter, including the impact 
of asset sales, new originations and the delinquency sales in the quarter. Had SoFi not sold these late stage 
delinquent loans, it is estimated that, including recoveries, they would have had an all-in annualized net charge-off 
rate for personal loans of approximately 4.5% vs. 4.8% in the prior quarter. 
The data continues to support a 7–8% maximum life of loan loss assumption for personal loans, in line with SoFi's 
underwriting tolerance.
Recent vintages, originated from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the third quarter of 2024 have net cumulative losses 
of 4.23%, with 41% unpaid principal balance remaining. This is well below the 5.75% observed at the same point in 
time for the 2017 vintage which is the last vintage that approached our 7-8% tolerance. The gap between the newer 
cohort curve and the 2017 cohort curve improved by 19 basis points, after improving 16 basis points last quarter, 
demonstrating continued improvement.
Additionally, of the first quarter of 2020 through the first quarter of 2025 originations, 60% of principal has already 
been paid down, with 6.7% in net cumulative losses. Therefore, for life-of-loan losses on this entire cohort of loans 
7

to reach 8%, the charge-off rate on the remaining 40% of unpaid principal would need to be approximately 10%. 
This would be well above past levels, providing further confidence in achieving loss rates below our 8% tolerance.

Guidance and Outlook
Given the strong first half of the year, management is increasing its 2025 guidance.
For the full year 2025, management now expects to deliver adjusted net revenue of approximately $3.375 billion, 
which is $65 million higher than the top end of the prior guidance range of $3.235 to $3.310 billion. This implies 
approximately 30% annual growth versus 24% to 27% in our prior guidance. Management expects adjusted 
EBITDA of approximately $960 million, above prior guidance of $875 to $895 million. This represents an EBITDA 
margin of 28%. SoFi expects GAAP net income of approximately $370 million, above prior guidance of $320 to 
$330 million. Lastly, SoFi expects GAAP EPS of approximately $0.31 cents per share, above prior guidance of 
$0.27 to $0.28 cents per share. This guidance assumes a tax rate of 26% for the remainder of the year. 
Management expects growth in tangible book value of approximately $640 million.
Management expects to add at least 3.0 million new members in 2025, which represents approximately 30% growth 
from 2024 levels.
Management will further address full-year guidance on the quarterly earnings conference call. Management has not 
reconciled forward-looking non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. This is 
because the company cannot predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable efforts the ultimate 
outcome of certain GAAP components of such reconciliations due to market-related assumptions that are not within 
our control as well as certain legal or advisory costs, tax costs or other costs that may arise. For these reasons, 
management is unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could materially 
impact the amount of the future directly comparable GAAP measures.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release presents information about certain non-GAAP financial measures provided as supplements to the 
results provided in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Our 
management and Board of Directors uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our operating performance, 
formulate business plans, help better assess our overall liquidity position, and make strategic decisions, including 
those relating to operating expenses and the allocation of internal resources. Accordingly, we believe that these non-
GAAP measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating 
results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. These non-GAAP measures have limitations 
as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the analysis of other GAAP 
financial measures. Other companies may not use these non-GAAP measures or may use similar measures that are 
defined in a different manner. Therefore, SoFi's non-GAAP measures may not be directly comparable to similarly 
titled measures of other companies.
Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are 
provided in Table 2 to the “Financial Tables” herein.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
(Unaudited)
Adjusted Net Revenue
Adjusted net revenue is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted net revenue is defined as total net revenue, adjusted to exclude the fair 
value changes in servicing rights and residual interests classified as debt due to valuation inputs and assumptions changes, which 
relate only to our Lending segment, as well as gains and losses on extinguishment of debt. We adjust total net revenue to exclude 
these items, as they are non-cash charges that are not realized during the period or not indicative of our core operating performance, 
and therefore positive or negative changes do not impact the cash available to fund our operations. Management believes this 
measure is useful because it enables management and investors to assess our underlying operating performance and cash available 
to fund our operations. In addition, management uses this measure to better decide on the proper expenses to authorize for each of 
our operating segments, to ultimately help achieve target contribution profit margins.
The following table reconciles adjusted net revenue to total net revenue, the most directly comparable GAAP measure:

(1)
Reflects changes in fair value inputs and assumptions on servicing rights, including conditional prepayment, default rates and discount rates. These assumptions 
are highly sensitive to market interest rate changes and are not indicative of our performance or results of operations. Moreover, these non-cash charges are 
unrealized during the period and, therefore, have no impact on our cash flows from operations.
(2)
Reflects changes in fair value inputs and assumptions on residual interests classified as debt, including conditional prepayment, default rates and discount rates. 
When third parties finance our consolidated securitization VIEs by purchasing residual interests, we receive proceeds at the time of the closing of the 
securitization and, thereafter, pass along contractual cash flows to the residual interest owner. These residual debt obligations are measured at fair value on a 
recurring basis, but they have no impact on our initial financing proceeds, our future obligations to the residual interest owner (because future residual interest 
claims are limited to contractual securitization collateral cash flows), or the general operations of our business. 
(3)
Reflects gain on extinguishment of debt. Gains and losses are recognized during the period of extinguishment for the difference between the net carrying 
amount of debt extinguished and the fair value of equity securities issued.

Adjusted noninterest income is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted noninterest income is defined as noninterest income, adjusted to 
exclude the fair value changes in servicing rights and residual interests classified as debt due to valuation inputs and assumptions 
changes, which relate only to our Lending segment, as well as gains and losses on extinguishment of debt. We adjust noninterest 
income to exclude these items, as they are non-cash charges that are not realized during the period or not indicative of our core

Reflects changes in fair value inputs and assumptions on servicing rights, including conditional prepayment, default rates and discount rates. These assumptions 
are highly sensitive to market interest rate changes and are not indicative of our performance or results of operations. Moreover, these non-cash charges are 
unrealized during the period and, therefore, have no impact on our cash flows from operations.

Reflects changes in fair value inputs and assumptions on residual interests classified as debt, including conditional prepayment, default rates and discount rates. 
When third parties finance our consolidated securitization VIEs by purchasing residual interests, we receive proceeds at the time of the closing of the 
securitization and, thereafter, pass along contractual cash flows to the residual interest owner. These residual debt obligations are measured at fair value on a 
recurring basis, but they have no impact on our initial financing proceeds, our future obligations to the residual interest owner (because future residual interest 
claims are limited to contractual securitization collateral cash flows), or the general operations of our business. 
(3)
Reflects gain on extinguishment of debt. Gains and losses are recognized during the period of extinguishment for the difference between the net carrying 
amount of debt extinguished and the fair value of equity securities issued.

Adjusted Contribution Margin and Incremental Adjusted Contribution Margin — Lending
Adjusted contribution margin and incremental adjusted contribution margin are non-GAAP measures and relate only to our Lending 
segment. Adjusted contribution margin is defined as segment contribution profit for the Lending segment, divided by adjusted net 
revenue for the Lending segment, a non-GAAP measure. Incremental adjusted contribution margin is defined as the change in 
segment contribution profit for our Lending segment, divided by change in adjusted net revenue for the Lending segment. See 
‘Adjusted Net Revenue’ above for a reconciliation of Lending segment adjusted net revenue.
Management believes adjusted contribution margin metrics are useful because they enable management and investors to assess the 
underlying operating performance of our Lending segment, by removing the impact of changes in volume over periods to present a 
comparable view of segment contribution profit, which is a measure of the direct profitability of each of our reportable segments, as 
a percentage of segment adjusted net revenue for the Lending segment during each period.

Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Incremental Adjusted EBITDA Margin
Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and incremental adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP measures. Adjusted 
EBITDA is defined as net income, adjusted to exclude, as applicable: (i) corporate borrowing-based interest expense (our adjusted 
EBITDA measure is not adjusted for warehouse or securitization-based interest expense, nor deposit interest expense and finance 
lease liability interest expense, as these are direct operating expenses), (ii) income tax expense (benefit), (iii) depreciation and 
amortization, (iv) share-based expense (inclusive of equity-based payments to non-employees), (v) restructuring charges, (vi) 
impairment expense (inclusive of goodwill impairments and property, equipment and software abandonments), (vii) transaction-
related expenses, (viii) foreign currency impacts related to operations in highly inflationary countries, (ix) fair value changes in each 
of servicing rights and residual interests classified as debt due to valuation assumptions, (x) gain on extinguishment of debt, and (xi) 
other charges, as appropriate, that are not expected to recur and are not indicative of our core operating performance.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is computed as adjusted EBITDA divided by adjusted net revenue. Incremental adjusted EBITDA margin 
is defined as the change in adjusted EBITDA, divided by change in adjusted net revenue. See ‘Adjusted Net Revenue’ above for a 
reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure.
Management believes adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and incremental adjusted EBITDA margin are useful measures 
for period-over-period comparisons of our business. These measures enable management and investors to assess our core operating 
performance or results of operations by removing the effects of certain non-cash items and charges, as well as the impact of changes 
in volume over periods as applicable. In addition, management uses these measures to help evaluate cash flows generated from 
operations and the extent of additional capital, if any, required to invest in strategic initiatives.

Our adjusted EBITDA measure adjusts for corporate borrowing-based interest expense, as these expenses are a function of our capital structure. Corporate 
borrowing-based interest expense includes interest on our revolving credit facility, as well as interest expense and the amortization of debt discount and debt 
issuance costs on our convertible notes. 
(2)
The income tax expense recognized in 2025 is primarily attributable to the Company’s profitability and discrete tax benefits for stock compensation recorded in 
each quarter.
(3)
Restructuring charges in the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 relate to legal entity restructuring.
(4)
Foreign currency charges reflect the impacts of highly inflationary accounting for our operations in Argentina, which are related to our Technology Platform 
segment and commenced in the first quarter of 2022 with the Technisys Merger.
(5)
Transaction-related expense in the 2024 periods included financial advisory and professional services costs associated with our acquisition of Wyndham.
(6)
Reflects changes in fair value inputs and assumptions, including market servicing costs, conditional prepayment, default rates and discount rates. This non-cash 
change is unrealized during the period and, therefore, has no impact on our cash flows from operations. As such, these positive and negative changes in fair 
value attributable to assumption changes are adjusted out of net income to provide management and financial users with better visibility into the earnings 
available to finance our operations. 
(7)
Reflects changes in fair value inputs and assumptions, including conditional prepayment, default rates and discount rates. When third parties finance our 
consolidated VIEs through purchasing residual interests, we receive proceeds at the time of the securitization close and, thereafter, pass along contractual cash

Tangible Book Value and Tangible Book Value per Common Share
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company modified the presentation of its tangible book value and tangible book value 
per share, which are non-GAAP measures. Tangible book value is defined as permanent equity, adjusted to exclude goodwill and 
intangible assets, net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents tangible book value at 
period-end divided by common stock outstanding at period-end. Prior periods were revised to conform with this presentation.
These measures are utilized by management in assessing our use of equity and capital adequacy. We believe that tangible book 
value presents a meaningful measure of net asset value, and tangible book value per share provides additional useful information to 
investors to assess capital adequacy.
The following table reconciles tangible book value to permanent equity, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and presents 
the computation of permanent equity per common share and tangible book value per common share for the periods presented:

Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Margin, Incremental Adjusted Net Income Margin and Adjusted EPS
Adjusted net income, adjusted net income margin, incremental adjusted net income margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share 
are non-GAAP measures. Adjusted net income is defined as net income, adjusted to exclude, as applicable, goodwill impairment 
expense and certain income tax benefits that are not expected to recur and are not indicative of our core operating performance.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share (“adjusted EPS”) is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts GAAP diluted earnings per 
share. Adjusted EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders, adjusted to exclude, as applicable, 
goodwill impairment expense and certain income tax benefits that are not expected to recur and are not indicative of our core 
operating performance, by the diluted weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, 
excluding the dilutive impact of the 2029 convertible notes under the if-converted method for which the 2029 capped call 
transactions would deliver shares to offset dilution.
Adjusted net income margin is computed as adjusted net income divided by adjusted net revenue. Incremental adjusted net income 
margin is defined as the change in adjusted net income, divided by change in adjusted net revenue. See ‘Adjusted Net Revenue’ 
above for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure.
Management believes adjusted net income, adjusted net income margin, incremental adjusted net income margin and adjusted EPS 
are useful because they enable management and investors to assess our core operating performance or results of operations, by 
removing the effects of certain non cash items and charges to present a comparable view for period over period comparisons of our 
business.

(3)
This non-GAAP adjustment excludes the dilutive impact of the 2029 convertible notes at stock prices below $14.54, as the 2029 capped call transactions in 
place will deliver shares to offset dilution. At stock prices in excess of $14.54, the Company would have an obligation to deliver cash or additional shares in 
excess of the dilution protection provided by the 2029 capped call transactions.

___________________
(1)
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we transferred the crypto services provided by SoFi Digital Assets, LLC, and began closing existing digital assets accounts and removing the account from Invest products. This 
process was completed in the first quarter of 2024.
Members
We refer to our customers as “members”. We define a member as someone who has a lending relationship with us through origination and/or ongoing servicing, opened a 
financial services account, linked an external account to our platform, or signed up for our credit score monitoring service. Our members have access to our CFPs, our member 
events, our content, educational material, news, and our tools and calculators, which are provided at no cost to the member. We view members as an indication not only of the 
size and a measurement of growth of our business, but also as a measure of the significant value of the data we have collected over time. 
Once someone becomes a member, they are always considered a member unless they are removed in accordance with our terms of service, in which case, we adjust our total 
number of members. This could occur for a variety of reasons—including fraud or pursuant to certain legal processes—and, as our terms of service evolve together with our 
business practices, product offerings and applicable regulations, our grounds for removing members from our total member count could change. The determination that a 
member should be removed in accordance with our terms of service is subject to an evaluation process, following the completion, and based on the results, of which, relevant 
members and their associated products are removed from our total member count in the period in which such evaluation process concludes. However, depending on the length 
of the evaluation process, that removal may not take place in the same period in which the member was added to our member count or the same period in which the 
circumstances leading to their removal occurred. For this reason, our total member count may not yet reflect adjustments that may be made once ongoing evaluation processes, 
if any, conclude. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, we aligned our methodology for calculating member and product metrics with our member and product definitions to 
include co-borrowers, co-signers, and joint- and co-account holders, as applicable. Quarterly amounts for prior periods were determined to be immaterial and were not recast.
Total Products
Total products refers to the aggregate number of lending and financial services products that our members have selected on our platform since our inception through the 
reporting date, whether or not the members are still registered for such products. Total products is a primary indicator of the size and reach of our Lending and Financial 
Services segments. Management relies on total products metrics to understand the effectiveness of our member acquisition efforts and to gauge the propensity for members to 
use more than one product. 
In our Lending segment, total products refers to the number of personal loans, student loans and home loans that have been originated through our platform through the 
reporting date, inclusive of loans which we originate as part of our Loan Platform Business, whether or not such loans have been paid off. If a member has multiple loan 
23

products of the same loan product type, such as two personal loans, that is counted as a single product. However, if a member has multiple loan products across loan product 
types, such as one personal loan and one home loan, that is counted as two products. The account of a co-borrower or co-signer is not considered a separate lending product.
In our Financial Services segment, total products refers to the number of SoFi Money accounts (inclusive of checking and savings accounts held at SoFi Bank and cash 
management accounts), SoFi Invest accounts, SoFi Credit Card accounts (including accounts with a zero dollar balance at the reporting date), referred loans (which are 
originated by a third-party partner to which we provide pre-qualified borrower referrals), SoFi At Work accounts and SoFi Relay accounts (with either credit score monitoring 
enabled or external linked accounts) that have been opened through our platform through the reporting date. Checking and savings accounts are considered one account within 
our total products metric. Our SoFi Invest service is composed of two products: active investing accounts and robo-advisory accounts. Our members can select any one or 
combination of the types of SoFi Invest products. If a member has multiple SoFi Invest products of the same account type, such as two active investing accounts, that is 
counted as a single product. However, if a member has multiple SoFi Invest products across account types, such as one active investing account and one robo-advisory 
account, those separate account types are considered separate products. The account of a joint- or co-account holder is considered a separate financial services product. In the 
event a member is removed in accordance with our terms of service, as discussed under “Members” above, the member’s associated products are also removed.
Technology Platform Total Accounts 
In our Technology Platform segment, total accounts refers to the number of open accounts at Galileo as of the reporting date. We include intercompany accounts on the 
Galileo platform as a service in our total accounts metric to better align with the Technology Platform segment revenue which includes intercompany revenue. Intercompany 
revenue is eliminated in consolidation. Total accounts is a primary indicator of the accounts dependent upon our technology platform to use virtual card products, virtual 
wallets, make peer-to-peer and bank-to-bank transfers, receive early paychecks, separate savings from spending balances, make debit transactions and rely upon real-time 
authorizations, all of which result in revenues for the Technology Platform segment. We do not measure total accounts for the Technisys products and solutions, as the revenue 
model is not primarily dependent upon being a fully integrated, stand-ready service.
