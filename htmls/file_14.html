Forward Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, which are
not historical facts, within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In some cases, you
can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as
“may,” “could,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek,” “anticipate,”

“believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” “likely,”
“will,” “would” and variations of these terms and similar
expressions, or the negative of these terms or similar expressions.
These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to,
statements concerning our expected financial performance, our
ability to implement our business strategy and anticipated business
and operations, and guidance for financial results for 2025. Such
forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates
and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by us and our
management, are inherently uncertain. As a result, readers are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those
expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements as a
result of risks and uncertainties impacting SoundHound’s business
including, our ability to successfully launch and commercialize new
products and services and derive significant revenue, our market
opportunity and our ability to acquire new customers and retain
existing customers, unexpected costs, charges or expenses resulting
from our 2024 acquisitions, the ability of our 2024 acquisitions to
be accretive on the company's financial results, and those other
factors described in our risk factors set forth in our filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including
our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q
and Current Reports on Form 8-K. We do not intend to update or
alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise, except as required by
applicable law.
Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance
To supplement the company’s financial statements, which are
presented on the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP), the following non-GAAP measures of financial
performance are included in this release: non-GAAP gross profit,
non-GAAP gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net loss and
non-GAAP earnings per share.
The company believes that providing this non-GAAP information in
addition to the GAAP financial information allows investors to view
the financial results in the way the company views its operating

results. The company also believes that providing this information
allows investors to not only better understand the company's
financial performance, but also, better evaluate the information
used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.
As such, the company believes that disclosing non-GAAP financial
measures to the readers of its financial statements provides the
reader with useful supplemental information that allows for greater
transparency in the review of the company’s financial and
operational performance.
The company defines its non-GAAP measures by excluding certain
items:
The company arrives at non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross
margin by excluding (i) amortization of intangibles (including
acquired intangible assets) and (ii) stock-based compensation.
The company arrives at adjusted EBITDA by excluding (i) total
interest and other income/(expense), net, (ii) loss on early
extinguishment of debt, (iii) income taxes, (iv) depreciation and
amortization expense (including acquired intangible assets), (v)
stock-based compensation, (vi) change in fair value of contingent
acquisition liabilities, and (vii) acquisition-related costs.
The company arrives at non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss
per share by excluding (i) depreciation and amortization expense
(including acquired intangible assets), (ii) stock-based
compensation, (iii) loss on early extinguishment of debt, (iv) change
in fair value of contingent acquisition liabilities, (v) change in fair
value of derivative, and (vi) acquisition-related costs.
Reconciliations of GAAP to these adjusted non-GAAP financial
measures are included in the tables below. When analyzing the
company's operating results, investors should not consider non-
GAAP measures as substitutes for the comparable financial
measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
To the extent that the company presents any forward-looking non-
GAAP financial measures, the company does not present a
quantitative reconciliation of such measures to the most directly

comparable GAAP financial measure (or otherwise present such
forward-looking GAAP measures) because it is impractical to do so.
