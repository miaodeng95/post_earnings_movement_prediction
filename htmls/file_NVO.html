Bagsværd, Denmark, 6 August 2025 - Financial report for the
period 1 January 2025 to 30 June 2025                                       

                                                                                                       
            
•  Operating profit increased by 25% in Danish kroner and 29%
at constant exchange rates (CER) to DKK 72.2 billion.
•  Sales in US Operations increased by 16% in Danish kroner
(17% at CER). Sales in the US were positively impacted by
gross-to-net sales adjustments related to prior years, including
an adjustment related to the 340B provision of around DKK 3
billion in the second quarter of 2025. Sales in International
Operations increased by 16% in Danish kroner (19% at CER).
•  Sales within Diabetes and Obesity care increased by 16% in
Danish kroner to DKK 145.4 billion (18% at CER), mainly
driven by Obesity care growth of 56% in Danish kroner to
DKK 38.8 billion (58% at CER) and GLP-1 diabetes sales
growing 8% in Danish kroner (10% at CER). Rare disease
sales increased by 14% measured in Danish kroner (15% at
CER).
•  Within R&D, Novo Nordisk will advance subcutaneous and
oral amycretin into phase 3 development in weight
management based on completed clinical studies during the
first quarter of 2025. Further, within obesity, REDEFINE 11
has been initiated to investigate further the potential efficacy
and safety of CagriSema, and semaglutide 7.2 mg (a higher
dose of Wegovy®) has been submitted to the EU regulatory
authorities.
•  For the 2025 outlook, sales growth is now expected to be
8-14% at CER, and operating profit growth is now expected
to be 10-16% at CER. Sales and operating profit growth
reported in Danish kroner is now expected to be 3 and 5
percentage points lower than at CER, respectively. The
lowered sales outlook for 2025 is driven by lower growth
expectations for the second half of 2025, reflecting the
persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected
market expansion and competition. The outlook is related to
lower growth expectations for Wegovy® in the US obesity
market, for Ozempic® in the US GLP-1 diabetes market as

well as for Wegovy® in select IO markets. Novo Nordisk
continues the global rollout of Wegovy® to more markets and
invests in commercial activities towards driving market
penetration for both Wegovy® and Ozempic®.
•  In July, Novo Nordisk announced that Maziar Mike Doustdar
will succeed Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen as president and chief
executive officer. Further, Novo Nordisk announced that it
has decided to consolidate its research and development areas
under the leadership of Martin Holst Lange. Lastly, Emil
Kongshøj Larsen will succeed Mike Doustdar as executive vice
president, International Operations. All changes are effective
7 August.

Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, president and CEO: "While delivering
18% sales growth in the first half of 2025, we have lowered our
full-year outlook due to lower growth expectations for our GLP-1
treatments in the second half of 2025. As a result, we are taking
measures to sharpen our commercial execution further, and ensure
efficiencies in our cost base while continuing to invest in future
growth. With more than one billion people living with obesity
globally, including more than 100 million living in the US, and only
a few million on treatment, I am confident that under Mike
Doustdar's leadership, Novo Nordisk will maximise the significant
growth opportunities, supported by a strong product portfolio and

future pipeline".
