Financial Outlook
The guidance provided below is based on Reddit’s current estimates and is not a guarantee of future 
performance. This guidance is subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to 
differ materially, including the risk factors discussed in Reddit’s reports on file with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Reddit undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statements 
or estimates, except as required by applicable law.
As we look ahead, we will share our internal thoughts on revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the third 
quarter. 
In the third quarter of 2025, we estimate:
•
Revenue in the range of $535 million to $545 million
•
Adjusted EBITDA2 in the range of $185 million to $195 million

Notes
1 The definitions of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow can be found in the Use 
of Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this release. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to 
the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure can be found on pages 10-11.
2 We have not provided a reconciliation to the forward-looking U.S. GAAP equivalent measures for our non-
GAAP guidance due to uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items. Therefore, 
a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance measures to their corresponding U.S. GAAP guidance 
measures is not available without unreasonable effort.

Forward Looking Statements 
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as 
amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform 
Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or Reddit's future financial or 
operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain 
words such as "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "going to," "could," "intends," "target," 
"projects," "contemplates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of 
these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern Reddit's expectations, strategy, priorities, 
plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this release include, but are not limited to, statements 
regarding Reddit’s future financial and operating performance and GAAP and non-GAAP guidance. 
Reddit's expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future 
periods are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those 
projected, including those more fully described under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in 
documents that Reddit files with the SEC from time to time, including Reddit’s Quarterly Report on Form 
10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, which is being filed with the SEC at or around the date hereof. 
The forward-looking statements in this release are based on information available to Reddit as of the date 
hereof, and Reddit undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required 
by law. 
A Note About Metrics 
We define a daily active unique (“DAUq”) as a user whom we can identify with a unique identifier who has 
visited a page on the Reddit website, www.reddit.com, or opened a Reddit application at least once during 
a 24-hour period. Average DAUq for a particular period is calculated by adding the number of DAUq on 
each day of that period and dividing that sum by the number of days in that period. 
We define a weekly active unique (“WAUq”) as a user whom we can identify with a unique identifier who 
has visited a page on the Reddit website, www.reddit.com, or opened a Reddit application at least once 
during a trailing seven-day period. Average quarterly WAUq for a particular period is calculated by adding 
the number of WAUq on each day of that period and dividing that sum by the number of days in that 
period.
We define average revenue per unique (“ARPU”) as quarterly revenue in a given geography divided by the 
average DAUq in that geography. For the purposes of calculating ARPU, advertising revenue in a given 
geography is based on the geographic location in which advertising impressions are delivered, as this 
approximates revenue based on user activity, while other revenue in a given geography is based on the 
billing address of the customer.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements, which 
are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP 
financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Free Cash Flow, and Free Cash Flow 
margin. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate reviews of our operational performance 
and as a basis for strategic planning. By excluding certain items that are non-recurring or not reflective of 
the performance of our normal course of business, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures 
provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. Accordingly, we believe these 
non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others because they allow investors to 
supplement their understanding of our financial trends and evaluate our ongoing and future performance 
in the same manner as management.  However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-
GAAP financial measures as they reflect the exercise of judgment by our management about which 
expenses are included or excluded in determining these non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures 
should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results 
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may 
4

calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as 
comparative measures.
A reconciliation is provided below for each historical non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly 
comparable financial measure stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reddit encourages investors to review 
the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to 
their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial 
measure to evaluate Reddit’s business. We have not provided a reconciliation to the forward-looking GAAP 
equivalent measures for our non-GAAP guidance due to uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability 
of, reconciling items. Therefore, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance measures to their 
corresponding GAAP guidance measures is not available without unreasonable effort.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) excluding interest (income) expense, net, income tax 
expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and related taxes, 
other (income) expense, net, and certain other non-recurring or non-cash items impacting net income (loss) 
that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing business performance. Other (income) expense, net 
consists primarily of realized gains and losses on sales of marketable securities, foreign currency 
transaction gains and losses, and other income and expense that are not indicative of our core operating 
performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. We consider the 
exclusion of certain non-recurring or non-cash items in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
margin to provide a useful measure for investors and others to evaluate our operating results in the same 
manner as management.
Free Cash Flow represents net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property 
and equipment. Free Cash Flow margin is defined as Free Cash Flow divided by revenue. We believe that 
Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures our ability to generate or 
use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance 
sheet and invest in future growth. Additionally, we believe that Free Cash Flow is an important measure 
since we use third-party infrastructure partners to host our services and therefore we do not incur 
significant capital expenditures to support revenue generating activities.
