Viking Therapeutics Reports Second Quarter
2025 Financial Results and Provides Corporate
Update
Conference call scheduled for 4:30 p.m. ET today
•  Phase 3 VANQUISH Registration Trials Underway for
VK2735 in Obesity
•  Phase 2 VENTURE-Oral Dosing Trial Enrollment
Completed; Top-Line Results Expected 2H25
•  Continued Progress with Amylin Program; IND Planned
4Q25
•  Strong Quarter-End Cash Position of $808 Million
SAN DIEGO, July 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Viking Therapeutics,
Inc. ("Viking") (Nasdaq: VKTX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical
company focused on the development of novel therapies for
metabolic and endocrine disorders, today announced its financial
results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2025,
and provided an update on its clinical pipeline and other corporate
developments.

Highlights from the Quarter Ended June 30, 2025, and Other
Recent Events:
"The Viking team achieved significant execution and clinical
milestones during the first half of 2025," stated Brian Lian, Ph.D.,
chief executive officer of Viking.  "With respect to our VK2735
program for obesity, we recently announced the initiation of the
VANQUISH Phase 3 registration program, consisting of two studies:
one in patients with obesity and one in patients with obesity and
type 2 diabetes.  Also during the first half of the year, we
announced both the initiation and completion of enrollment in the
Phase 2 VENTURE-Oral Dosing study of our oral tablet formulation
of VK2735.  We believe the study's rapid enrollment speaks to
continued strong demand for new and differentiated weight loss
therapies.  We remain on track to announce top-line data from the
VENTURE-Oral study in the second half of the year.  With respect to
our amylin agonist program, we continue to make progress toward
an IND filing, which we expect to submit later this year. 
Importantly, we completed the second quarter with a strong
balance sheet providing the runway to support the advancement of
VK2735 through Phase 3 clinical trials, in addition to supporting
further progress with other key development programs."
Pipeline and Recent Corporate Highlights
•  Phase 3 VANQUISH Registration Trials for Subcutaneous
VK2735 Underway. VK2735 is a wholly owned long-acting
dual agonist of the glucagon like peptide-1, or GLP-1
receptor, and the glucose dependent insulinotropic
polypeptide, or GIP receptor, for the potential treatment of
obesity and other metabolic disorders.
In 2024, Viking announced positive top-line results from its
Phase 2 VENTURE study of subcutaneous VK2735 in obesity. 
The VENTURE trial successfully achieved its primary and
secondary endpoints, with subjects receiving VK2735
demonstrating statistically significant reductions in body
weight compared with placebo.  After 13 weekly doses,
subjects receiving VK2735 demonstrated statistically
significant reductions in mean body weight from baseline,

ranging up to 14.7%.  VK2735 also demonstrated
encouraging safety and tolerability in the VENTURE study,
with the majority of observed adverse events (AEs) being
reported as mild or moderate.  Treatment and study
discontinuation rates among VK2735 cohorts were well-
balanced compared with placebo.  The results of the
VENTURE study were presented in November 2024 at
ObesityWeekâ, the annual meeting of The Obesity Society.
Based on these promising Phase 2 results, along with
feedback from a Type C meeting and subsequent End of Phase
2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
the company advanced VK2735 into Phase 3 development for
obesity.  In the second quarter, the company announced the
initiation of the VANQUISH Phase 3 clinical program, which
includes two studies evaluating VK2735: one in adults with
obesity and one in adults with obesity or who are overweight
and have type 2 diabetes.  Each study is a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial designed to
assess the efficacy and safety of VK2735 administered by
subcutaneous injection once weekly for 78 weeks.  The
VANQUISH-1 study will target enrollment of approximately
4,500 adults with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) or who are
overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2) with at least one weight-
related co-morbid condition.  The VANQUISH-2 study will
target enrollment of approximately 1,100 adults with type 2
diabetes with obesity or who are overweight.  Participants in
both trials will be randomized to one of four weekly
treatment arms of 7.5 mg, 12.5 mg, 17.5 mg, or placebo.
The primary endpoint of the trials is the percent change in
body weight from baseline for participants receiving VK2735
as compared to placebo after 78 weeks of treatment. 
Secondary and exploratory endpoints will evaluate a range of
additional safety and efficacy measures, including the
percentage of patients who achieve ≥5%, ≥10%, ≥15% and
≥20% body weight reduction.  Each study will include an
open-label extension allowing participants the opportunity to
continue receiving treatment following completion of the
primary dosing period.

Viking will provide further updates on the VANQUISH
program as these studies progress.
•  Phase 2 VENTURE-Oral Dosing Trial Enrollment
Completed; Top-Line Results Expected 2H25.  Concurrent
with the development of a subcutaneous formulation, Viking
is also developing an oral tablet formulation of VK2735,
which the company believes could represent an attractive
treatment option for people who may prefer to initiate
treatment with an oral therapy, or for those seeking to
maintain the weight loss they have already achieved.  A
differentiating feature of the tablet formulation of VK2735 is
that it offers the potential to transition subjects from the
subcutaneous formulation to an oral formulation of the same
molecule.  Viking believes this may reduce the risk of
unexpected safety or tolerability challenges and could be an
appealing option for both patients and clinicians.
In 2024, Viking reported the results from a Phase 1 multiple
ascending dose trial evaluating oral VK2735 doses ranging
from 2.5 mg to 100 mg.  This trial successfully achieved its
primary and secondary objectives, with the results showing
that cohorts receiving VK2735 demonstrated dose-dependent
reductions in mean body weight from baseline, ranging up to
8.2% after 28 days.  Persistent weight loss effects ranging up
to 8.3% from baseline were observed at follow-up visits
through Day 57, four weeks after the last dose of VK2735 was
administered.  Oral VK2735 also demonstrated encouraging
safety and tolerability through 28 days of once-daily dosing at
doses up to and including 100 mg.  The majority of observed
treatment emergent adverse events were mild or moderate,
with the majority reported as mild.  These results were
presented last November at ObesityWeek 2024.
In January 2025, the company announced the initiation of
the Phase 2 VENTURE-Oral Dosing trial in subjects with
obesity.  This trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety,
tolerability, pharmacokinetics and weight loss efficacy of

VK2735 dosed as an oral tablet once daily for 13 weeks.  The
target population consists of adults with obesity (BMI ≥30
kg/m2) or who are overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2) with at
least one weight-related co-morbid condition.  Enrolled
subjects are evenly randomized to one of six dosing arms or
placebo.  The primary endpoint of the study is the percent
change in body weight from baseline after 13 weeks of
treatment.  Secondary and exploratory endpoints will
evaluate a range of additional safety and efficacy measures.
In March, Viking announced completion of enrollment for this
trial, enrolling approximately 280 patients.  The company
expects to report the results from this study in the second half
of 2025.
•  Continued Progress with Dual Amylin and Calcitonin
Receptor Agonist (DACRA) Program; IND Expected 4Q25. 
The amylin and calcitonin receptors have been shown to play
an important role in food intake and metabolic control,
making them attractive therapeutic targets for obesity.
In 2024 Viking announced a new, internally developed
DACRA program for the treatment of obesity.  In vivo data
from this program were presented at the 2024 American
Diabetes Association's (ADA's) Annual Scientific Sessions. 
The company's ADA presentation highlighted the effects of
treatment on body weight, food intake and metabolic profile
in both healthy rats and in diet-induced obese mice.  The
results demonstrated that Viking's DACRAs reduced food
intake in rodents following a single subcutaneous dose.  
Viking plans to file an investigational new drug (IND)
application for this program in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Second Quarter and Six Months 2025 Financial Highlights
Second Quarter ended June 30, 2025 and 2024
Research and development expenses were $60.2 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $23.8 million for
the same period in 2024.  The increase was primarily due to
increased expenses related to clinical studies, manufacturing for the
company's drug candidates, pre-clinical studies, stock-based
compensation and salaries and benefits.
General and administrative expenses were $14.4 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $10.3 million for
the same period in 2024.  The increase was primarily due to
increased expenses related to stock-based compensation and salaries
and benefits, partially offset by decreased expenses related to legal
and patent services.
For the three months ended June 30, 2025, Viking reported a net
loss of $65.6 million, or $0.58 per share, compared to a net loss of
$22.3 million, or $0.20 per share, in the corresponding period in
2024.  The increase in net loss for the three months ended June 30,
2025, was primarily due to the increase in research and

development expenses and general and administrative expenses,
noted previously, compared to the same period in 2024.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2025 and 2024
Research and development expenses were $101.5 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $47.9 million for the
same period in 2024. The increase was primarily due to increased
expenses related to clinical studies, manufacturing for the
company's drug candidates, stock-based compensation and salaries
and benefits, partially offset by decreased expenses related to pre-
clinical studies.
General and administrative expenses were $28.5 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $20.3 million for the
same period in 2024. The increase was primarily due to increased
expenses related to stock-based compensation, legal and patent
services and insurance, partially offset by decreased expenses
related to third party consultants. 
For the six months ended June 30, 2025, Viking reported a net loss
of $111.2 million, or $0.99 per share, compared to a net loss of
$49.6 million, or $0.46 per share, in the corresponding period in
2024. The increase in net loss for the six months ended June 30,
2025, was primarily due to the increase in research and
development expenses and general and administrative expenses,
noted previously, partially offset by increased interest income,
compared to the same period in 2024. 
Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2025
At June 30, 2025, Viking held cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments of $808 million, compared to $903 million as of
December 31, 2024.

About Viking Therapeutics, Inc.
Viking Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical
company focused on the development of novel first-in-class or best-
in-class therapies for the treatment of metabolic and endocrine
disorders. Viking's research and development activities leverage its
expertise in metabolism to develop innovative therapeutics
designed to improve patients' lives. Viking's clinical programs
include VK2735, a novel dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide 1
(GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)
receptors for the potential treatment of various metabolic disorders.
The company is evaluating its subcutaneous formulation of VK2735
in a Phase 3 obesity program that includes two Phase 3 clinical
trials (VANQUISH-1 and VANQUISH-2). Data from a Phase 1 and a
Phase 2 trial evaluating subcutaneous VK2735 demonstrated an
encouraging safety and tolerability profile as well as positive signs
of clinical benefit. Concurrently, the company is evaluating an oral
formulation of VK2735 in a Phase 2 trial in obesity. Viking is also
developing VK2809, a novel, orally available, small molecule
selective thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist for the treatment of
lipid and metabolic disorders. The compound successfully achieved
both the primary and secondary endpoints in a recently completed
Phase 2b study for the treatment of biopsy-confirmed non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis. In a Phase 2a trial for the
treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and elevated
LDL-C, patients who received VK2809 demonstrated statistically
significant reductions in LDL-C and liver fat content compared with
patients who received placebo. The company's newest program is
evaluating a series of internally developed dual amylin and
calcitonin receptor agonists (or DACRAs) for the treatment of

obesity and other metabolic disorders.  In the rare disease space,
Viking is developing VK0214, a novel, orally available, small
molecule selective thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist for the
potential treatment of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD).  In
a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with the
adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) form of X-ALD, VK0214
demonstrated a promising safety profile and was well-tolerated,
while driving significant reductions in plasma levels of very long-
chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and other lipids, as compared to
placebo.
