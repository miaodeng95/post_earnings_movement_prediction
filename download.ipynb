Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q \\nfor the quarter ended June 30, 2025, and may be set forth in other reports and filings we make with the SEC. All \\ninformation provided in this release and in the attachments is as of July 23, 2025. Undue reliance should not be placed \\non the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to us on the date \\nhereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.\\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we \\nuse the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change \\nin constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in \\nisolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with \\nGAAP.\\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate \\nperiod-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental \\ninformation regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our \\nrecurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate \\nmovements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management \\nand investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when \\nplanning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s \\ninternal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating \\nresults. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater \\ntransparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) \\nthey are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these \\nlimitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial \\nmeasures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in \\naccordance with GAAP.\\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the sections captioned “Reconciliation from \\nGAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow” and “Reconciliation from GAAP \\nRevenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to Non-GAAP \\nPercentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues” included at the end of this release.\\nContact\\nInvestor relations\\nMedia\\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz press@abc.xyz\\n3\\n\\nAlphabet

Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions \\nreceived for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, \\nand other enterprise services.\\n•\\nOther Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues \\nfrom Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs \\nprimarily include certain AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; \\ncorporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human \\nresource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance \\nand office space reductions are also not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to \\nrevenue are not allocated to our segments.\\n7\\n\\nOther Income (Expense), Net\\nThe following table presents our other income (expense), net (in millions; unaudited):\\nQuarter Ended June 30,\\n2024\\n2025\\nInterest income\\n$ \\n1,090 $ \\n1,050 \\nInterest expense\\n \\n(67)  \\n(261) \\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss), net\\n \\n(173)  \\n(69) \\nGain (loss) on debt securities, net\\n \\n(310)  \\n165 \\nGain (loss) on equity securities, net(1)\\n \\n(714)  \\n1,286 \\nPerformance fees\\n \\n128  \\n(83) \\nIncome (loss) and impairment from equity method investments, net\\n \\n32  \\n419 \\nOther\\n \\n140  \\n155 \\nOther income (expense), net\\n$ \\n126 $ \\n2,662 \\n(1)\\nIncludes all gains and losses, unrealized and realized, on equity securities. For Q2 2025, the net effect of the gain on equity \\nsecurities of $1.3 billion and the performance fees related to certain investments of $83 million increased the provision for \\nincome tax, net income, and diluted net income per share by $253 million, $950 million, and $0.08, respectively. \\nFluctuations in the value of our investments may be affected by market dynamics and other factors and could significantly \\ncontribute to the volatility of OI&E in future periods.\\nReconciliation from GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow (in \\nmillions; unaudited):\\nWe provide non-GAAP free cash flow for the current quarter and trailing twelve months (“TTM”) because it is a \\nliquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash \\ngenerated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and \\nacquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet. \\nQuarter Ended\\nTTM\\nQ3 2024\\nQ4 2024\\nQ1 2025\\nQ2 2025\\nQ2 2025\\nNet cash provided by operating activities\\n$ 30,698 $ 39,113 $ 36,150 $ 27,747 \\n$ 133,708 \\nLess: purchases of property and equipment\\n (13,061)  (14,276)  (17,197)  (22,446)  (66,980) \\nFree cash flow\\n$ 17,637 $ 24,837 $ 18,953 $ \\n5,301 \\n$ 66,728 \\nFree cash flow: We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.\\nTTM free cash flow: We define trailing twelve months free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital \\nexpenditures for the most recent twelve consecutive months.\\n8\\n\\nReconciliation from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage \\nChange in Revenues to Non-GAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues (in millions, except \\npercentages; unaudited):\\nWe provide non-GAAP constant currency revenues (“constant currency revenues”) and non-GAAP percentage change \\nin constant currency revenues (“percentage change in constant currency revenues”), because they facilitate the \\ncomparison of current results to historic performance by excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements (“FX \\nEffect”) as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level, as they are not indicative of our \\ncore operating results.\\nNon-GAAP constant currency revenues is defined as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate \\nmovements and hedging activities and is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange \\nrates and excluding any hedging effect recognized in the current period. We calculate the percentage change in \\nconstant currency revenues by comparing constant currency revenues to the prior year comparable period revenues, \\nexcluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period.\\nRevenues by Geography\\nComparison from the Quarter Ended June 30, 2024 to the Quarter Ended June 30, 2025\\nQuarter Ended June 30, 2025\\n% Change from Prior Period\\nQuarter Ended June 30,\\nLess FX \\nEffect\\nConstant \\nCurrency \\nRevenues\\nAs \\nReported\\nLess \\nHedging \\nEffect\\nLess FX \\nEffect\\nConstant \\nCurrency \\nRevenues\\n2024\\n2025\\nUnited States\\n$ \\n41,196 \\n$ \\n46,063 \\n$ \\n0 \\n$ \\n46,063 \\n 12 %\\n 0 %\\n 12 %\\nEMEA\\n \\n24,683 \\n \\n28,262 \\n \\n780 \\n \\n27,482 \\n 14 %\\n 3 %\\n 11 %\\nAPAC\\n \\n13,823 \\n \\n16,480 \\n \\n115 \\n \\n16,365 \\n 19 %\\n 1 %\\n 18 %\\nOther Americas\\n \\n4,938 \\n \\n5,735 \\n \\n(352)  \\n6,087 \\n 16 %\\n (7) %\\n 23 %\\nRevenues, excluding hedging effect\\n \\n84,640 \\n \\n96,540 \\n \\n543 \\n \\n95,997 \\n 14 %\\n 1 %\\n 13 %\\nHedging gains (losses)\\n \\n102 \\n \\n(112) \\nTotal revenues(1)\\n$ \\n84,742 \\n$ \\n96,428 \\n$ \\n95,997 \\n 14 %\\n 0 %\\n 1 %\\n 13 %\\n(1)\\nTotal constant currency revenues of $96.0 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 increased $11.4 billion compared to $84.6 billion in \\nrevenues, excluding hedging effect, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\\nComparison from the Quarter Ended March 31, 2025 to the Quarter Ended June 30, 2025\\nQuarter Ended June 30, 2025\\n% Change from Prior Period\\nQuarter Ended\\nLess FX \\nEffect\\nConstant \\nCurrency \\nRevenues\\nAs \\nReported\\nLess \\nHedging \\nEffect\\nLess FX \\nEffect\\nConstant \\nCurrency \\nRevenues\\nMarch 31, \\n2025\\nJune 30, \\n2025\\nUnited States\\n$ \\n43,964 \\n$ \\n46,063 \\n$ \\n0 \\n$ \\n46,063 \\n 5 %\\n 0 %\\n 5 %\\nEMEA\\n \\n25,923 \\n \\n28,262 \\n \\n1,270 \\n \\n26,992 \\n 9 %\\n 5 %\\n 4 %\\nAPAC\\n \\n14,854 \\n \\n16,480 \\n \\n242 \\n \\n16,238 \\n 11 %\\n 2 %\\n 9 %\\nOther Americas\\n \\n5,233 \\n \\n5,735 \\n \\n109 \\n \\n5,626 \\n 10 %\\n 2 %\\n 8 %\\nRevenues, excluding hedging effect  \\n89,974 \\n \\n96,540 \\n \\n1,621 \\n \\n94,919 \\n 7 %\\n 2 %\\n 5 %\\nHedging gains (losses)\\n \\n260 \\n \\n(112) \\nTotal revenues(1)\\n$ \\n90,234 \\n$ \\n96,428 \\n$ \\n94,919 \\n 7 %\\n 0 %\\n 2 %\\n 5 %\\n(1)\\nTotal constant currency revenues of $94.9 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 increased $4.9 billion compared to $90.0 billion in \\nrevenues, excluding hedging effect, for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.\\n9\\n\\nTotal Revenues — Prior Year Comparative Periods\\nComparison from the Quarter Ended June 30, 2023 to the Quarter Ended June 30, 2024\\nQuarter Ended June 30, 2024\\nQuarter Ended June 30,\\n% Change from Prior Period\\n \\nLess FX \\nEffect\\nConstant \\nCurrency \\nRevenues\\nAs \\nReported\\nLess \\nHedging \\nEffect\\nLess FX \\nEffect\\nConstant \\nCurrency \\nRevenues\\n2023\\n2024\\nRevenues excluding hedging effect\\n$ \\n74,601 \\n$ \\n84,640 \\n$ \\n(1,267) $ \\n85,907 \\n 13 %\\n (2) %\\n 15 %\\nHedging gains (losses)\\n$ \\n3 \\n$ \\n102 \\nTotal revenues\\n$ \\n74,604 \\n$ \\n84,742 \\n$ \\n85,907 \\n 14 %\\n 1 %\\n (2) %\\n 15 %\\n10</pre></body></html>'"
