Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To provide investors with additional information regarding the
Company’s financial results, this press release includes references to
certain non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management.
The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures
including Adjusted Gross Profit, Contribution Profit, Adjusted Net
Loss, Adjusted EBITDA, and any such non-GAAP financial measures
expressed as a Margin, are useful to investors as supplemental
operational measurements to evaluate the Company’s financial
performance.
The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for the Company’s reported GAAP results
because they may include or exclude certain items as compared to
similar GAAP-based measures, and such measures may not be

comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other
companies. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures
for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to
evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Management believes that
these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful
supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance by
excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the Company’s
recurring operating results.
Adjusted Gross Profit and Contribution Profit
To provide investors with additional information regarding our
margins and return on inventory acquired, we have included
Adjusted Gross Profit and Contribution Profit, which are non-GAAP
financial measures. We believe that Adjusted Gross Profit and
Contribution Profit are useful financial measures for investors as
they are supplemental measures used by management in evaluating
unit level economics and our operating performance. Each of these
measures is intended to present the economics related to homes
sold during a given period. We do so by including revenue
generated from homes sold (and adjacent services) in the period
and only the expenses that are directly attributable to such home
sales, even if such expenses were recognized in prior periods, and
excluding expenses related to homes that remain in inventory as of
the end of the period. Contribution Profit provides investors a
measure to assess Opendoor’s ability to generate returns on homes
sold during a reporting period after considering home purchase
costs, renovation and repair costs, holding costs and selling costs.
Adjusted Gross Profit and Contribution Profit are supplemental
measures of our operating performance and have limitations as
analytical tools. For example, these measures include costs that
were recorded in prior periods under GAAP and exclude, in
connection with homes held in inventory at the end of the period,
costs required to be recorded under GAAP in the same period.
Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation
or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.
We include a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measure, which is gross profit.
Adjusted Gross Profit / Margin

We calculate Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit under GAAP
adjusted for (1) inventory valuation adjustment in the current
period, and (2) inventory valuation adjustment in prior periods.
Inventory valuation adjustment in the current period is calculated
by adding back the inventory valuation adjustments recorded
during the period on homes that remain in inventory at period end.
Inventory valuation adjustment in prior periods is calculated by
subtracting the inventory valuation adjustments recorded in prior
periods on homes sold in the current period. Adjusted Gross Margin
is Adjusted Gross Profit as a percentage of revenue.
We view this metric as an important measure of business
performance as it captures gross margin performance isolated to
homes sold in a given period and provides comparability across
reporting periods. Adjusted Gross Profit helps management assess
home pricing, service fees and renovation performance for a specific
resale cohort.
Contribution Profit / Margin
We calculate Contribution Profit as Adjusted Gross Profit, minus
certain costs incurred on homes sold during the current period
including: (1) holding costs incurred in the current period,
(2) holding costs incurred in prior periods, and (3) direct selling
costs. Contribution Margin is Contribution Profit as a percentage of
revenue.
We view this metric as an important measure of business
performance as it captures the unit level performance isolated to
homes sold in a given period and provides comparability across
reporting periods. Contribution Profit helps management assess
inflows and outflows directly associated with a specific resale
cohort.

Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EBITDA
We also present Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EBITDA, which are
non-GAAP financial measures that management uses to assess our
underlying financial performance. These measures are also
commonly used by investors and analysts to compare the
underlying performance of companies in our industry. We believe
these measures provide investors with meaningful period over
period comparisons of our underlying performance, adjusted for
certain charges that are non-cash, not directly related to our
revenue-generating operations, not aligned to related revenue, or
not reflective of ongoing operating results that vary in frequency
and amount.
Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures
of our operating performance and have important limitations. For
example, these measures exclude the impact of certain costs
required to be recorded under GAAP. These measures also include
inventory valuation adjustments that were recorded in prior periods
under GAAP and exclude, in connection with homes held in
inventory at the end of the period, inventory valuation adjustments
required to be recorded under GAAP in the same period. These
measures could differ substantially from similarly titled measures
presented by other companies in our industry or companies in other
industries. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported
under GAAP. We include a reconciliation of these measures to the
most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which is net
loss.
Adjusted Net Loss
We calculate Adjusted Net Loss as GAAP net loss adjusted to
exclude non-cash expenses of stock-based compensation, equity
securities fair value adjustment, intangibles amortization expense,
and the amortization of stock-based compensation capitalized to
internally developed software (“IDSW”). It excludes expenses that
are not directly related to our revenue-generating operations such
as restructuring and legal contingency accruals. It also excludes
(gain) loss on extinguishment of debt as these gains or expenses
were incurred as a result of decisions made by management to

terminate or partially extinguish portions of our outstanding credit
facilities or convertible senior notes early; these expenses are not
reflective of ongoing operating results and vary in frequency and
amount. Adjusted Net Loss also aligns the timing of inventory
valuation adjustments recorded under GAAP to the period in which
the related revenue is recorded in order to improve the
comparability of this measure to our non-GAAP financial measures
of unit economics, as described above. Our calculation of Adjusted
Net Loss does not currently include the tax effects of the non-GAAP
adjustments because our taxes and such tax effects have not been
material to date.
Adjusted EBITDA / Margin
We calculated Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted Net Loss adjusted for
depreciation and amortization, property financing and other
interest expense, interest income, and income tax expense. Adjusted
EBITDA is a supplemental performance measure that our
management uses to assess our operating performance and the
operating leverage in our business. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is
Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.
The following table presents a reconciliation of our Adjusted Net
Loss and Adjusted EBITDA to our net loss, which is the most
directly comparable GAAP measure, for the periods indicated:

________________
(1) Represents the gains and losses on certain financial instruments,
which are marked to fair value at the end of each period.
(2) Represents amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.
The acquired intangible assets had useful lives ranging from 1 to
5 years and amortization was incurred until the intangible assets
were fully amortized in 2024.
(3) Beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2025, the Company
revised the presentation of the amortization of stock-based
compensation capitalized to IDSW to more appropriately present
the full impact of all stock-based compensation expenses. This
expense was previously included in “Depreciation and amortization,
excluding amortization of intangibles.” Had this presentation been
applied for the three months ended December 31, 2024, September
30, 2024, and June 30, 2024, Adjusted Net Loss would have
improved by $3 million, $3 million, and $3 million, respectively,
and by $7 million for the six month ended June 30, 2024, with no
impact to Adjusted EBITDA.
(4) Inventory valuation adjustment includes adjustments to record
real estate inventory at the lower of its carrying amount or its net
realizable value.
(5) Inventory valuation adjustment — Current Period is the

inventory valuation adjustments recorded during the period
presented associated with homes that remain in inventory at period
end.
(6) ​Inventory valuation adjustment — Prior Periods is the inventory
valuation adjustments recorded in prior periods associated with
homes that sold in the period presented.
(7) Restructuring costs consist primarily of severance and employee
termination benefits and bonuses incurred in connection with the
elimination of employees’ roles, consulting fees and expenses
related to the termination of certain leases incurred during the
restructuring process.
(8) Primarily includes gain on deconsolidation, net, related party
services income, and sublease income.
(9) ​Includes interest expense on our non-recourse asset-backed debt
facilities.
(10) ​Includes amortization of debt issuance costs and loan
origination fees, amortization of debt discounts, commitment fees,
unused fees, other interest related costs on our asset-backed debt
facilities, and interest expense related to the convertible senior
notes outstanding.
(11) Consists mainly of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents,
restricted cash and marketable securities.
1 Opendoor has not provided a quantitative reconciliation of
forecasted Contribution Profit to forecasted GAAP gross profit (loss)
nor a reconciliation of forecasted Adjusted EBITDA to forecasted
GAAP net income (loss) within this press release because the
Company is unable, without making unreasonable efforts, to
calculate certain reconciling items with confidence. These items
include, but are not limited to, inventory valuation adjustment and
equity securities fair value adjustment. These items, which could
materially affect the computation of forward-looking GAAP gross
profit (loss) and net income (loss), are inherently uncertain and

depend on various factors, some of which are outside of the
Company’s control. For more information regarding the non-GAAP
financial measures discussed in this press release, please see “Use of
Non-GAAP Financial Measures” following the financial tables
below.
