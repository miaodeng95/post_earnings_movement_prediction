Measures" and "GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliations" for more information on the Company's non-GAAP measures and its share count. Certain 
figures throughout this document may not foot due to rounding.
2 GAAP net income was $34 million, while GAAP net income attributable to Rocket Companies, Inc (after non-controlling interest attribution) 
was negative. This was due to interest and amortization expense related to the $4.0 billion of senior notes issued by Rocket Companies, Inc. 
during the quarter which was not attributable to the non-controlling interests, resulting in the $(0.01) of GAAP diluted loss per share.

Company Highlights
•
Rocket Mortgage clients can now complete their refinance journey fully digitally, seamlessly navigating every 
step—from pulling credit and selecting a product and rate to submitting the application, receiving 
automated approval updates, e-signing, and scheduling the closing. Clients are now able to complete a 
digital refinance from application to rate lock in under 30 minutes—entirely online and at any time of day, 
even outside of traditional business hours. We’re continually enhancing this experience, with the goal of 
making refinancing as simple as pressing a "refi button" on any mortgage we service.
•
In June, Rocket Mortgage launched a new feature in its AI-powered banker communication platform, which 
brings calls, texts, and soon, chats into one unified interface. AI-powered tools help bankers connect more 
efficiently, with new features surfacing client needs and enabling quicker follow-up. These enhancements 
have boosted daily refinance client follow-ups by 20%, allowing bankers to serve more clients. 
•
In Q2, Rocket Mortgage launched an agentic AI tool within the Rocket Logic loan origination system to handle 
reviewing earnest money deposits (EMD), the funds buyers provide to show commitment in a home 
purchase. Previously, tracking and validating EMDs involved significant manual work; now, agentic AI verifies 
documentation and traces funds automatically. This technology processes EMDs for 80% of purchase 
agreements, saving nearly 20,000 hours annually and allowing clients to progress through the home buying 
process faster.
•
In Q2, Rocket Mortgage introduced several upgrades to support mortgage broker partners. Enhancements 
include an improved self-serve portal that gives brokers better pipeline visibility and expanded self-service 
options. These changes have resulted in significant time savings and nearly 20% reduction in outbound 
outreach. In addition, over 1,000 partners have adopted Rocket's enhanced broker compensation split 
program, which offers greater pricing flexibility and allows brokers to tailor compensation structures to fit the 
needs of their business.
•
In June, Rocket Mortgage launched a bridge loan product, giving homebuyers the financial flexibility to 
purchase their next primary residence before selling their current one. By removing the hurdle of contingent 
offers, this product helps clients compete more effectively in today’s market.
•
In July, Rocket Mortgage was named #1 in client satisfaction for mortgage servicing by J.D. Power for the 11th 
time, based on feedback from nearly 16,000 homeowners. Rocket Mortgage led in overall satisfaction, ease of 
doing business, client care, and digital experience, supported by AI tools that streamline service and improve 
results. This recognition highlights Rocket's continued leadership in client service and its commitment to 
creating a seamless homeownership experience.
•
In June, Rocket Companies held its largest hackathon to date. Over a 24-hour period, 166 participants across 
the company worked on 38 projects to create transformative homeownership technology solutions. Projects 
in the event showcased cutting-edge technology, including AI models from Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic, 
advanced vector databases and search technologies, cross-platform mobile and web development 
frameworks, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and secure cloud infrastructure.
•
On July 1, Rocket Mortgage introduced Rocket Preferred Pricing, a new program to make homeownership 
more affordable. Clients who finance their home with Rocket Mortgage and either purchase a home listed by 
a Redfin agent or work with a Redfin agent are eligible for a one percentage point reduction in their interest 
rate for the first year of their loan, or a lender credit at closing of up to $6,000. 
•
On July 1, the Company completed an all-stock acquisition of Redfin Corporation. Under the agreement, each 
Redfin share was exchanged for 0.7926 shares of Rocket Companies Class A common stock, increasing 
Rocket's Class A float to 12%. Founded in 2004, Redfin is one of the most recognized real estate brands in the 
U.S., drawing 50 million monthly active visitors, featuring over 1 million for-sale and rental listings, and is 
supported by a tech-enabled brokerage of more than 2,200 lead agents.

•
Rocket Companies took steps to streamline operations and narrow strategic focus. In the second quarter, the 
Company shut down Rocket Mortgage Canada operations. In July, the Company initiated the wind-down of 
the Rocket Visa Signature Card credit card program. 
•
On June 20, the Company issued $2.0 billion of 6.125% senior notes due 2030 and $2.0 billion of 6.375% 
senior notes due 2033. Rocket intends to use the proceeds from the debt offering, on the closing date for the 
Mr. Cooper acquisition, to redeem Nationstar Mortgage Holding Inc.'s ("NMH"), a subsidiary of Mr. Cooper, 
senior notes due 2026, 2027 and 2028, and pay fees and expenses related to the offering and redemption. At 
the Company's discretion, it may also redeem, purchase and/or amend NMH's senior notes due 2029, 2030, 
2031 and 2032, and pay associated expenses, as well as repay secured debt of Rocket and its subsidiaries 
(including Redfin, Mr. Cooper and their subsidiaries). All actions related to NMH's senior notes are contingent 
on the closing of the Mr. Cooper transaction, which remains on track in the fourth quarter. 
•
On June 30, the Company completed the simplification of its capital and organizational structure through the 
collapse of its "Up-C" structure, providing that each class of common stock will be entitled to one vote per 
share, and reducing its classes of common stock from four to two (the "Up-C Collapse"). The collapse 
simplifies Rocket's organizational structure, improves its ability to use its common stock as currency in 
acquisition transactions and creates a clearer corporate profile.
•
Rocket Mortgage held its seventh annual Rocket Classic event from June 26 to 29, 2025 at the Detroit Golf 
Club. Since 2019, the Rocket Classic has raised over $10 million for local charitable organizations, including 
over $6 million for its Changing The Course initiative, which helps Detroit residents access high-speed 
internet, digital devices and digital literacy training.
•
On June 28, the Rocket Community Fund and the Detroit Housing Commission announced a new program to 
provide free high-speed home internet to 450 families in Detroit Housing Commission communities. 
Supported by an $850,000 investment from Rocket Community Fund and additional funding from Microsoft's 
Airband Initiative, the project will deliver free internet access for three years, along with community 
engagement and digital skills training to support residents long-term.
Third Quarter 2025 Outlook 
3 
In Q3 2025, we expect adjusted revenue between $1.600 billion to $1.750 billion. 
This outlook incorporates a full quarter of consolidated financial results from Redfin Corporation.

Direct to Consumer
In the Direct to Consumer segment, clients have the ability to interact with Rocket Mortgage digitally and/or with 
the Company’s mortgage bankers. The Company markets to potential clients in this segment through various 
brand campaigns and performance marketing channels. The Direct to Consumer segment derives revenue from 
originating, closing, selling and servicing predominantly agency-conforming loans, which are pooled and sold to 
the secondary market. The segment also includes title and settlement services and appraisal management, 
complementing the Company’s end-to-end mortgage origination experience. Servicing activities are fully 
allocated to the Direct to Consumer segment and are viewed as an extension of the client experience. Servicing 
enables Rocket Mortgage to establish and maintain long term relationships with our clients, through multiple 
touchpoints at regular engagement intervals.

companies that find value in our award-winning client experience and want to offer their clients mortgage 
solutions with our trusted, widely recognized brand. These organizations connect their clients directly to us 
through marketing channels and a referral process. Our influencer partnerships are typically with companies that 
employ licensed mortgage professionals that find value in our client experience, technology and efficient

4 We measure the performance of the Direct to Consumer and Partner Network segments primarily on a contribution margin basis. 
Contribution margin is intended to measure the direct profitability of each segment and is calculated as Adjusted revenue less directly 
attributable expenses. Directly attributable expenses include salaries, commissions and team member benefits, general and administrative 
expenses, marketing and advertising expenses and other expenses, such as mortgage servicing related expenses and expenses generated 
from Rocket Close (title and settlement services). A loan is considered "sold" when it is sold to investors on the secondary market. See 
"Summary Segment Results" section below and "Segments" footnote in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in the Company's 
forthcoming filing on Form 10-Q for more information.

We measure the performance of the segments primarily on a contribution margin basis. Contribution margin is intended to measure 
the direct profitability of each segment and is calculated as Adjusted revenue less directly attributable expenses. Adjusted revenue 
is a non-GAAP financial measure described below. Directly attributable expenses include salaries, commissions and team member 
benefits, general and administrative expenses, marketing and advertising expenses and other expenses, such as mortgage servicing 
related expenses and expenses generated from Rocket Close (title and settlement services).

taxes assuming Rocket Companies, Inc. owns 100% of the non-voting common interest units of Holdings and (b) the (benefit from) 
provision for income taxes. The effective income tax rate was 21.39% and 24.40% for the three months ended June 30, 2025 and 
2024, respectively. The effective income tax rate was 24.68% and 24.40% for the six months ended June  30, 2025 and 2024,

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
To provide investors with information in addition to our results as determined by GAAP, we disclose Adjusted 
revenue, Adjusted net income, Adjusted diluted earnings per share and Adjusted EBITDA (collectively “our non-
GAAP financial measures”) as non-GAAP measures which management believes provide useful information to 
investors. We believe that the presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to 
investors regarding our results of operations because each measure assists both investors and management in 
analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. Our non-GAAP financial measures are 
not calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for revenue, net income 
(loss), or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may 
define our non-GAAP financial measures differently, and as a result, our measures of our non-GAAP financial 
measures may not be directly comparable to those of other companies. Our non-GAAP financial measures 
provide indicators of performance that are not affected by fluctuations in certain costs or other items. 
Accordingly, management believes that these measurements are useful for comparing general operating 
performance from period to period, and management relies on these measures for planning and forecasting of 
future periods. Additionally, these measures allow management to compare our results with those of other 
companies that have different financing and capital structures.
We define “Adjusted revenue” as total revenues net of the change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights 
(“MSRs”) due to valuation assumptions (net of hedges). We define “Adjusted net income” as tax-effected net 
income (loss) before share-based compensation expense, the change in fair value of MSRs due to valuation 
assumptions (net of hedges), acquisition-related expenses, the change in Tax receivable agreement liability and 
the tax effects of those adjustments as applicable. We define “Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share” as 
Adjusted net income divided by the adjusted diluted weighted average shares outstanding which includes 
diluted weighted average Participating Common Stock and the assumed pro forma exchange and conversion of 
Class D common stock outstanding for the applicable period presented. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as net 
income (loss) before interest and amortization expense on non-funding debt, (benefit from) provision for income 
taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, change in fair value of MSRs due to 
valuation assumptions (net of hedges), acquisition-related expenses and the change in Tax receivable 
agreement liability.
We exclude from each of our non-GAAP financial measures the change in fair value of MSRs due to valuation 
assumptions (net of hedges), as this represents a non-cash non-realized adjustment to our total revenues, 
reflecting changes in market interest rates and assumptions, including discount rates and prepayment speeds, 
which are not indicative of our performance or results of operation. We also exclude gains or losses on sales of 
MSRs during the period and effects of contractual prepayment protection associated with sales of MSRs. 
Adjusted EBITDA includes Interest expense on funding facilities, which are recorded as a component of Interest 
income, net, as these expenses are a direct cost driven by loan origination volume. By contrast, interest and 
amortization expense on non-funding debt is a function of our capital structure and is therefore excluded from 
Adjusted EBITDA.
Our definitions of each of our non-GAAP financial measures allow us to add back certain cash and non-cash 
charges, and deduct certain gains that are included in calculating Total revenue, net, Net (loss) income 
attributable to Rocket Companies or Net income (loss). However, these expenses and gains vary greatly, and are 
difficult to predict. From time to time in the future, we may include or exclude other items if we believe that doing 
so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors.
12 

Although we use our non-GAAP financial measures to assess the performance of our business, such use is limited 
because they do not include certain material costs necessary to operate our business. Our non-GAAP financial 
measures can represent the effect of long-term strategies as opposed to short-term results. Our presentation of 
our non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be 
unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Our non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical 
tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under 
U.S. GAAP. Because of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as measures 
of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be 
available to us to meet our obligations.
For financial outlook information, the Company is not providing a quantitative reconciliation of adjusted revenue 
to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because the GAAP measure cannot be reliably estimated and the 
reconciliation cannot be performed without unreasonable effort due to their dependence on future uncertainties 
and adjusting items that the Company cannot reasonably predict at this time but which may be material.
As of June 30, 2025, the effective date of the Up-C Collapse, the Company applies the two-class method for 
calculating and presenting earnings per share by separately presenting earnings per share for Class A common 
stock and Class L common stock ("Participating Common Stock").
