•  Sequential improvement to the balance sheet and record cash
balance of $390.8 million, as of June 30, 2025, positioning the
Company to accelerate growth.
•  Company now projects full-year 2025 revenue between $125
million and $140 million.
MCLEAN, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:
BBAI) (“BigBear.ai” or the “Company”), a leader in AI-powered
decision intelligence solutions, today announced financial results
for the second quarter of 2025 and issued an investor presentation
that has been posted to the Investor Relations section of the
Company’s website.
"Our robust balance sheet allows us to make significant
transformational investments to shape the future of BigBear.ai. Our
capital raising activities this quarter coincide with the tremendous
opportunities we see coming from the One Big Beautiful Bill,
particularly in the Department of Homeland Security, and several of
which are uniquely aligned to our core capabilities. This legislation
will bring a generational investment and provides over $170 billion
in supplemental funding to the Department of Homeland Security,
and $150 billion to the Department of Defense for disruptive
defense technology. This is not incremental funding for innovation -
this is a transformative level of investment. As a Mission Ready AI
company with a national and border security focus, it’s directly in
our lane,” said Kevin McAleenan, CEO of BigBear.ai.
"Beyond the opportunities that we’re pursuing in the U.S., this

quarter, we signed a transformative partnership with leading
companies in the UAE under the IHC umbrella focused on
accelerating the development and adoption of AI across several
domains and applications. This is just the beginning of our
international expansion and demonstrates the need for BigBear.ai’s
technology and solutions across the globe,” he continued.
“While we are very optimistic with these significant investments
and growth opportunities, we have also seen disruptions in federal
contracts from efficiency efforts this quarter, most notably in
programs that support the U.S. Army, as they seek to consolidate
and modernize their data architecture and in turn, we have adjusted
our full-year guidance this quarter to reflect these disruptions,” he
concluded.
“Our record cash balance will enable us to make significant
investments, both organically and inorganically, in an order of
magnitude that was not possible before,” said Sean Ricker, CFO of
BigBear.ai.
Financial Highlights
•  Revenue decreased 18% to $32.5 million for the second
quarter of 2025, compared to $39.8 million for the second
quarter of 2024 primarily due to lower volume on certain
Army programs.
•  Gross margin was 25.0% in the second quarter of 2025,
compared to 27.8% in the second quarter of 2024.
•  Net loss in the second quarter of 2025 was $228.6 million,
compared to a net loss of $14.4 million for the second quarter
of 2024. The increase in net loss was primarily driven by non-
cash changes in derivative liabilities of $135.8 million
associated with changes in the fair value of the convertible
features of the 2029 Notes and warrants, as well as a non-
cash goodwill impairment charge of $70.6 million.
•  Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA* of $(8.5) million for the second
quarter of 2025 compared to $(3.7) million for the second
quarter of 2024, primarily driven by decreased gross margin
as well as an increase in research and development expenses.
•  SG&A of $21.5 million for the second quarter of 2025
compared to $23.4 million for the second quarter of 2024.

The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by lower
legal expenses ($1.7 million), and lower bonus expense ($1.1
million).
•  Backlog of $380 million as of June 30, 2025.
Financial Outlook
For the year-ended December 31, 2025, the Company now projects:
•  Revenue between $125 million and $140 million
Due to uncertainty on certain Army programs as well as new
anticipated growth investment spending in the second half of the
year, at this time, the Company is withdrawing its previously
provided Adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year-ended December
31, 2025. The Company expects to provide updated Adjusted
EBITDA guidance at a later date. The above information on
financial outlook, and other sections of this release contain forward-
looking statements, which are based on the Company’s current
expectations. Actual results may differ materially from those
projected. It is the Company’s practice not to incorporate
adjustments into its financial outlook for proposed acquisitions,
divestitures, changes in law, or new accounting standards until such
items have been consummated, enacted, or adopted, as the case
may be. For additional factors that may impact the Company’s
actual results, refer to the “Forward-Looking Statements” section in
this release.
*EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are
non-GAAP financial measures. See the “Non-GAAP Financial
Measures” section in this press release for additional information
and reconciliations.

The change in fair value of derivatives
during the three months ended June 30,
2025 relates to the remeasurement of the
2025 warrants, IPO warrants and the 2026
and 2029 Notes Conversion Options
derivative liabilities. The change during the
six months ended June 30, 2025, relates to
the $14.0 million loss recorded upon the
exercise of the 2024 RDO and 2024 PIPE
Warrants (the “2024 Warrants”) and
issuance of the warrants in 2025 (the “2025
Warrants”) in connection with the warrant
exercise agreements entered into on
February 5, 2025. During the six months
ended June 30, 2025, there was loss related
to a mark-to-market adjustment of $59.9M
adjustment for the debt to equity conversions
during the period. There was an offsetting
gain related to the fair market value
adjustment on the 2025 warrants and the
private warrants of $2.6 million.
Additionally, there was an loss of $7.0
million fair market value adjustment of the
2026 and 2029 Notes Conversion Option,
during the six months ended June 30, 2025.
 
The decrease in fair value of derivatives
during the three months ended June 30,
2024 relates to remeasurement of the 2024
Warrants and IPO Warrant’s fair value. The
increase in fair value of derivatives during
the six months ended June 30, 2024, relates
to the $42.3 million loss recorded upon the
exercise of the 2023 RDO and 2023 PIPE
Warrants (the “2023 Warrants”) in
connection with the warrant exercise
agreements entered into on February 27,

2024 and March 4, 2024. This loss was offset
by gains of $10.6 million, net of cash
proceeds received, related to the issuance of
warrants in 2024 (the “2024 Warrants”). In
addition, an $18.3 million reduction in fair
value was recorded on the 2024 Warrants
issued in connection with the warrant
exercise agreements as the fair value
decreased from the issue date to quarter end.
(3)
During the three and six months ended June
30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, the Company
incurred employee separation costs
associated with a strategic review of the
Company’s capacity and future projections to
better align the organization and cost
structure and improve the affordability of its
products and services.
(4)
Non-recurring professional fees related to the
execution of certain strategic initiatives of
the Company.

(5)
Non-recurring litigation consists primarily of
legal settlements and related fees for specific
proceedings that we have determined arise
outside of the ordinary course of business
based on the following considerations which
we assess regularly: (1) the frequency of
similar cases that have been brought to date,
or are expected to be brought within two
years; (2) the complexity of the case; (3) the
nature of the remedy(ies) sought, including
the size of any monetary damages sought;
(4) offensive versus defensive posture of us;
(5) the counterparty involved; and (6) our
overall litigation strategy.
(6)
Transaction expenses during the quarter
ended March 31, 2024 consist primarily of
diligence, legal and other related expenses
incurred associated with the Pangiam
acquisition.
(7)
Non-recurring internal integration costs
related to the Pangiam acquisition.

(8)
During the three months ended March 31,
2024, the Company recognized a non-cash
goodwill impairment charge primarily driven
by a decrease in share price during the
quarter compared to the share price of the
equity issued as consideration for the
purchase of Pangiam. During the six months
ended June 30, 2025, the company
recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment
charge of $70.6 million, primarily driven by
a change in forecast during the second
quarter of 2025.
(9)
Loss on extinguishment of debt is related to
voluntary conversions of the 2029 Notes to
common stock and the related
extinguishment of unamortized debt
discount and debt costs.

Forward-Looking Statements

This release contains forward-looking statements regarding future
events and our future results that are subject to the safe harbors
created under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking
statements generally are accompanied by words such as “believe,”
“may,” “will,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,”
“expect,” “should,” “would,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,”
“potential,” “seem,” “seek,” “future,” “outlook,” and similar
expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that
are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking
statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our
industry, future events, and other statements that are not historical
facts. These statements are based on current expectations and
beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects
on us and should not be relied upon as representing BigBear’s
assessment as of any date subsequent to the date of this release.
There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us
will be those that we have anticipated. Many actual events and
circumstances are beyond our control. These forward-looking
statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties,
including those relating to: changes in domestic and foreign
business, market, financial, political, and legal conditions; the
uncertainty of projected financial information; delays caused by
factors outside of our control, including changes in fiscal or
contracting policies or decreases in available government funding,
including as a result of events such as war, incidents of terrorism,
natural disasters, and public health concerns or epidemics; changes
in government programs or applicable requirements; budgetary
constraints, including any potential constraints as a result of recent
or future federal government layoffs, including automatic
reductions as a result of “sequestration” or similar measures and
constraints imposed by any lapses in appropriations for the federal
government or certain of its departments and agencies, including
government shutdowns or the ability of the U.S. federal government
to unilaterally cancel a contract with or without cause, and more
specifically, the potential impact of the U.S. DOGE Service
Temporary Organization on government spending and terminating
contracts for convenience; the failure of contracts comprising
backlog to result in revenue due to changes in funding, terminations

for convenience, or option periods going unexercised; the impact of
tariffs or other restrictive trade measures; implementation of
spending limits or changes in budgetary constraints; influence by,
or competition from, third parties with respect to pending, new, or
existing contracts with government customers; changes in our
ability to successfully compete for and receive task orders and
generate revenue under Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity
contracts; our ability to realize the benefits of the strategic
partnerships; risks that the new businesses will not be integrated
successfully or that the combined companies will not realize
estimated cost savings; failure to realize anticipated benefits of the
combined operations; potential delays or changes in the
government appropriations or procurement processes; our ability to
remediate a material weakness in our internal control over financial
reporting; risks regarding the market and our customers accepting
and adopting our products, including future new product offerings;
the high degree of uncertainty of the level of demand for, and
market utilization of, our solutions and products; our ability to
successfully execute and realize the benefits of joint ventures,
channel sales relationships, partnerships, strategic alliances,
subcontracting opportunities, customer contracts and other
commercial agreements to which we are a party; and those factors
discussed in the Company’s reports and other documents filed with
the SEC, including under the heading “Risk Factors.” If any of these
risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results
could differ materially from those projected by these forward-
looking statements. There may be additional risks that we presently
do not know or that we currently believe are immaterial which
could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the
forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements
reflect our expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and
views as of the date of this release. We anticipate that subsequent
events and developments will cause our assessments to change.
However, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.
Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-
looking statements.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The financial information and data contained in this press release is

unaudited. Some of the financial information and data contained in
this press release, such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted
EBITDA Margin have not been prepared in accordance with United
States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). To
supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with
GAAP in our press release, we also report certain non-GAAP
financial measures. A “non-GAAP financial measure” refers to a
numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial
performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes (or
includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most
directly comparable measure calculated and presented in
accordance with GAAP in such company’s financial statements.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation
or as a substitute for the relevant GAAP measures and should be
read in conjunction with information presented on a GAAP basis.
Because not all companies use identical calculations, our
presentation of non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to
other similarly titled measures of other companies.
The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to,
financial information prepared and presented in accordance with
GAAP and should not be considered measures of BigBear.ai’s
liquidity. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations
associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an
analytical tool. In particular, many of the adjustments to our GAAP
financial measures reflect the exclusion of certain items, as defined
in our non-GAAP definitions below, which are recurring and will be
reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future. In
addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial
measures used by other companies, even where similarly titled,
limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes and therefore
should not be used to compare BigBear.ai’s performance to that of
other companies. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of
the non-GAAP financial measures presented by also providing the
most directly comparable GAAP measures and descriptions of the
reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP financial
measures.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors
and analysts with useful supplemental information about the
financial performance of our business, enable comparison of
financial results between periods where certain items may vary
independent of business performance, and allow for greater
transparency with respect to key measures used by management to
operate and analyze our business over different periods of time.
EBITDA is defined as net loss before interest expense, interest
income, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and
amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further
adjusted for equity-based compensation, employer payroll taxes
related to equity-based compensation, net increase in fair value of
derivatives, restructuring charges, non-recurring strategic
initiatives, non-recurring integration costs, non-recurring litigation,
transaction expenses, goodwill impairment, and loss on
extinguishment of debt.
Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a
percentage of Revenue.
Similar excluded expenses may be incurred in future periods when
calculating these measures. BigBear.ai believes these non-GAAP
measures of financial results provide useful information to
management and investors regarding certain financial and business
trends relating to the Company’s financial condition and results of
operations. BigBear.ai believes that the use of these non-GAAP
financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use
in evaluating projected operating results and trends and in
comparing BigBear.ai’s financial measures with other similar
companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial
measures to investors.
Management does not consider these non-GAAP measures in
isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in
accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP
financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and
income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s
financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent
limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management
about which expense and income items are excluded or included in

determining these non-GAAP financial measures.
Management uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA
Margin as non-GAAP performance measures which are reconciled to
the most directly comparable GAAP measure, in the tables included
in this release. The Company does not reconcile forward-looking
non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable
GAAP financial measure (or otherwise describe such forward-
looking GAAP measure) because it is not able to forecast the most
directly comparable measure calculated and presented in
accordance with GAAP without unreasonable effort. Certain
elements of the composition of the GAAP amounts are not
predictable, making it impracticable for the Company to forecast.
As a result, no guidance for the Company’s net (loss) income or
reconciliation of the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA guidance is
provided. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to assess the
probable significance of the unavailable information, which could
have a potentially significant impact on its future net income (loss).
We present reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to
the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables included
in this release.
