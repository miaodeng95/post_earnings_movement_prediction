SANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AMD
(NASDAQ:AMD) today announced financial results for the second
quarter of 2025. Second quarter revenue was a record $7.7 billion,
gross margin was 40%, operating loss was $134 million, net income
was $872 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.54. On a
non-GAAP(*) basis, gross margin was 43%, operating income was
$897 million, net income was $781 million and diluted earnings per
share was $0.48. As previously announced, our second quarter
results were impacted by the U.S. Government's export control on
our AMD Instinct™ MI308 data center GPU products. For the
quarter, these restrictions led to approximately $800 million in

inventory and related charges. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP
gross margin would have been approximately 54%.
“We delivered strong revenue growth in the second quarter led by
record server and PC processor sales,” said Dr. Lisa Su, AMD Chair
and CEO. “We are seeing robust demand across our computing and
AI product portfolio and are well positioned to deliver significant
growth in the second half of the year, driven by the ramp of our
AMD Instinct MI350 series accelerators and ongoing EPYC and
Ryzen processor share gains.”
“We achieved 32% year-over-year revenue growth and generated
record free cash flow this quarter, reflecting our disciplined
execution,” said Jean Hu, AMD EVP, CFO and Treasurer. “Our
strategic investments across hardware, software and systems
position us well to support robust future growth and drive long-
term shareholder value.”

Segment Summary
•  Data Center segment revenue was $3.2 billion, up 14% year-
over-year primarily driven by strong demand for AMD EPYC™
processors more than offsetting headwinds impacting AMD
Instinct MI308 shipments to China.
•  Client and Gaming segment revenue was $3.6 billion, up 69%
year-over-year. Client revenue was a record $2.5 billion, up
67% year-over-year primarily driven by strong demand for
the latest “Zen 5” AMD Ryzen™ desktop processors and a

richer product mix. Gaming revenue was $1.1 billion, up 73%
year-over-year driven by an increase in semi-custom revenue
and strong AMD Radeon™ GPU demand.
•  Embedded segment revenue was $824 million, down 4%
year-over-year as demand in end markets remained mixed.

Current Outlook
AMD’s outlook statements are based on current expectations. The
following statements are forward-looking and actual results could
differ materially depending on market conditions and the factors set
forth under “Cautionary Statement” below.
For the third quarter of 2025, AMD expects revenue to be
approximately $8.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. At the mid-
point of the revenue range, this represents year-over-year growth of
approximately 28% and sequential growth of approximately 13%.
Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 54%. Our
current outlook does not include any revenue from AMD Instinct
MI308 shipments to China as our license applications are currently
under review by the U.S. Government.

(*) In this earnings press release, in addition to GAAP financial
results, AMD has provided non-GAAP financial measures
including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-
GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses/
revenue percent, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP
operating margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP
diluted earnings per share. AMD uses a normalized tax rate in
its computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to
provide better consistency across the reporting periods. For
fiscal 2025, AMD used a non-GAAP tax rate of 13%, which
excludes the tax impact of pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments.
Additionally, AMD has provided an adjusted non-GAAP gross
profit and gross margin which excludes the inventory and
related charges associated with U.S. export restrictions. AMD
also provides adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and free cash
flow margin as supplemental non-GAAP measures of its
performance. These items are defined in the footnotes to the
selected corporate data tables provided at the end of this
earnings press release. AMD is providing these financial
measures because it believes this non-GAAP presentation
makes it easier for investors to compare its operating results
for current and historical periods and also because AMD
believes it assists investors in comparing AMD’s performance
across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding
items that it does not believe are indicative of its core
operating performance and for the other reasons described in
the footnotes to the selected data tables. The non-GAAP
financial measures disclosed in this earnings press release
should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for or
superior to AMD’s reported results prepared in accordance
with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with AMD’s
Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance
with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures referenced are
reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial
measures in the data tables in this earnings press release. This
earnings press release also contains forward-looking non-GAAP
gross margin concerning AMD’s financial outlook, which is
based on current expectations as of August 5, 2025, and
assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and
uncertainties. Adjustments to arrive at the GAAP gross margin

outlook typically include stock-based compensation,
amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-
related and other costs. The timing and impact of such
adjustments are dependent on future events that are typically
uncertain or outside of AMD's control, therefore, a
reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures is not practicable
at this time. AMD undertakes no intent or obligation to
publicly update or revise its outlook statements as a result of
new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be
required by law.

Adjusted EBITDA
$         1,088  
 
$         1,954  
The Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA” as a supplemental measure of its
performance. Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting GAAP
net income for interest expense, other (income) expense, net, income tax
provision (benefit), equity income in investee, stock-based compensation,
depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of acquisition-related
intangibles, inventory loss at contract manufacturer, acquisition-related and other
costs, restructuring charges, and income from discontinued operations, net of tax.
The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management
believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall
capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the
Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists
investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent
basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its
core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may
or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies
in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an
alternative to the GAAP operating measure of net income or GAAP liquidity
measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In
addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets
and liabilities that can affect cash flows.

The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure
of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash
provided by operating activities of continuing operations for capital expenditures,
and free cash flow margin % is free cash flow expressed as a percentage of the
Company's net revenue. The Company calculates and communicates free cash
flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of
importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The
Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the
calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors
should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of
cash flows from operating activities.
