Second Quarter 2025
Financial Results,
Current Operational
and Financial
Highlights
Riot Reports $219.5 million in
Net Income and $495.3 million
in Adjusted EBITDA
CASTLE ROCK, Colo., July 31,
2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Riot
Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: RIOT)

(“Riot” or “the Company”), a
Bitcoin-driven industry leader in
the development of large-scale data
centers for high performance
computing and bitcoin mining
applications, reported financial
results for the three-month period
ended June 30, 2025. The
accompanying presentation
materials are available on Riot’s
website.
“I am pleased to announce Riot’s
results for the second quarter of
2025,” said Jason Les, CEO of Riot.
“Strong tailwinds in the price of
bitcoin contributed to Riot

achieving a record $219.5 million
in net income and $495.3 million
in adjusted EBITDA, representing
exceptionally strong results for the
quarter.
“We are immensely proud of our
evolution over the past several
years, having built world-class
capabilities in power procurement,
Bitcoin mining at global scale, and
infrastructure engineering,
culminating in a strong position to
control our destiny and maximize
shareholder value. Our strategy
centers on optimizing our ready-
for-service power portfolio –

anchored by flagship sites in
Rockdale and Corsicana – while
progressively shifting capacity
toward high-value data centers,
bolstered by our addition of
hyperscale expertise through recent
hires, in particular Jonathan Gibbs
as Chief Data Center Officer. With
a robust balance sheet, battle-
hardened teams, and significant
access to capital markets, we are
uniquely positioned at the
intersection of surging high
performance computing demand
and Bitcoin growth to maximize
utilization of our significant power
capacity, expand thoughtfully, and

drive compelling long-term value
for our shareholders.”

Second Quarter 2025 Financial
and Operational Highlights
Key financial and operational
highlights for the second quarter
include:
•  Total revenue of $153.0 million,
as compared to $70.0 million for
the same three-month period in
2024. The increase was primarily
driven 
by 
a 
$85.1 
million
increase 
in 
Bitcoin 
Mining
revenue.
•  Produced 
1,426 
bitcoin, 
as

compared to 844 during the
same 
three-month 
period 
in
2024.
•  The average cost to mine bitcoin,
excluding 
depreciation, 
was
$48,992 
in 
the 
quarter, 
as
compared to $25,329 per bitcoin
in the same three-month period
in 
2024. 
The 
increase 
was
primarily driven by the block
subsidy ‘halving’ event, which
occurred in April 2024, and a
45% increase in the average
global network hash rate as
compared to the same period in
2024.
•  Bitcoin 
Mining 
revenue 
of
$140.9 million for the quarter, as
compared to $55.8 million for
the same three-month period in

2024, primarily driven by higher
average bitcoin prices and an
increase in operational hash rate,
partially offset by the block
subsidy ‘halving’ event and an
increase in the average global
network hash rate.
•  Engineering revenue of $10.6
million 
for 
the 
quarter, 
as
compared to $9.6 million for the
same 
three-month 
period 
in
2024. Riot has benefited from
$18.5 million in capex savings
alone since the acquisition of
ESS Metron in December 2021,
representing a key advantage of
the 
Company’s 
vertical
integration strategy.
•  Maintained 
industry-leading
financial position, with $141.1

million 
in 
working 
capital,
including 
$255.4 
million 
in
unrestricted cash on hand, $74.9
million in restricted cash, and
$62.5 
million 
in 
marketable
equity securities.
•  Held 19,273 bitcoin (of which
3,300 
is 
currently 
held 
as
collateral), 
equating 
to
approximately $2.1 billion based
on a market price for one bitcoin
on June 30, 2025, of $107,174.

Non-U.S. GAAP Measures of
Financial Performance
In addition to financial measures
presented under generally accepted
accounting principles in the United
States of America (“GAAP”), we
consistently evaluate our use of
and calculation of non-GAAP
financial measures such as
“Adjusted EBITDA.” EBITDA is
computed as net income before
interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is a
performance measure defined as

EBITDA, adjusted to eliminate the
effects of certain non-cash and/or
non-recurring items that do not
reflect our ongoing strategic
business operations, which
management believes results in a
performance measurement that
represents a key indicator of the
Company’s core business
operations of Bitcoin mining. The
adjustments include fair value
adjustments such as derivative
power contract adjustments, equity
securities value changes, and non-
cash stock-based compensation
expense, in addition to financing
and legacy business income and

expense items. We exclude
impairments and gains or losses on
sales or exchanges of Bitcoin from
our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA
for all periods presented.
We believe Adjusted EBITDA can
be an important financial measure
because it allows management,
investors, and our board of
directors to evaluate and compare
our operating results, including our
return on capital and operating
efficiency from period-to-period by
making such adjustments.
Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is
used as a performance metric for

share-based compensation.
Adjusted EBITDA is provided in
addition to, and should not be
considered to be a substitute for, or
superior to, net income, the most
comparable measure under GAAP
for Adjusted EBITDA. Further,
Adjusted EBITDA should not be
considered as an alternative to
revenue growth, net income,
diluted earnings per share or any
other performance measure
derived in accordance with GAAP,
or as an alternative to cash flow
from operating activities as a
measure of our liquidity. Adjusted

EBITDA has limitations as an
analytical tool, and you should not
consider such measures either in
isolation or as substitutes for
analyzing our results as reported
under GAAP.
The following table reconciles
Adjusted EBITDA to Net income

financial measure:

(2) During the
three and six
months ended
June 30, 2025
and 2024, we
paid cash of
approximately
$92.3 million
and 
$190.9
million,
respectively,
in 
total
deposits 
and
payments for
the purchase
of 
miners.
Costs 
to

finance 
the
purchase 
of
miners 
were
zero 
in 
all
periods
presented 
as
the 
miners
were paid for
with 
cash
from 
the
Company’s
cash balance.
The seller did
not 
provide
any financing
nor did the
Company

borrow from a
third-party to
purchase the
miners.

(3) 
Power
curtailment
credits 
are
credited
against 
our
power
invoices as a
result 
of
temporarily
pausing 
our
operations to
participate in
ERCOT’s
Demand
Response
Service
Programs.

Our 
fixed-
price 
power
purchase
contracts
enable us to
strategically
curtail 
our
mining
operations
and
participate in
these
programs,
which
significantly
lower our cost
to 
mine

bitcoin. These
credits 
are
recognized
outside of cost
of revenue in
Power
curtailment
credits on our
Condensed
Consolidated
Statements of
Operations,
but 
they
significantly
reduce 
our
overall cost to
mine bitcoin.

(4) 
We
capitalize the
acquisition
cost 
of 
our
miners 
and
include these
costs 
in
Property 
and
equipment, net
on 
our
Condensed
Consolidated
Balance
Sheets. 
The
miners 
are
depreciated
over 
an

estimated
useful life of
three 
years,
during which
time 
the
miners 
are
expected 
to
generate
bitcoin
revenue. 
We
do 
not
consider
depreciation
expense 
in
determining
whether it is
economical to

operate 
our
miners 
since
depreciation
is a non-cash
expense 
and
is 
not 
a
variable
operating cost
that can be
avoided even
if we curtail
operations
temporarily.
Depreciation
expense
incurred 
is
disclosed 
for

each
respective
period in the
table above.

The
