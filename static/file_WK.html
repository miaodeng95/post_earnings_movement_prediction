Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The non-GAAP adjustments referenced herein relate to the
exclusion of stock-based compensation and amortization of
acquisition-related intangible assets. A reconciliation of GAAP to
non-GAAP historical financial measures has been provided in Table
I at the end of this press release. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-
GAAP guidance has been provided in Table II at the end of this
press release.
Workiva believes that the use of non-GAAP gross profit and gross
margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income,
non-GAAP net income per share, free cash flow and free cash flow
margin is helpful to its investors. These measures, which are
referred to as non-GAAP financial measures, are not prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States, or GAAP. Workiva’s management uses these non-
GAAP financial measures as tools for financial and operational
decision making and for evaluating Workiva’s own operating results
over different periods of time.
Non-GAAP gross margin is the ratio calculated by dividing non-
GAAP gross profit by revenues. Non-GAAP gross profit is calculated
by excluding stock-based compensation expense attributable to cost
of revenues from gross profit. Non-GAAP income from operations is
calculated by excluding stock-based compensation expense and
amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets from
loss from operations. Non-GAAP net income is calculated by
excluding stock-based compensation expense, net of tax and
amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets from
net loss. Non-GAAP net income per share is calculated by dividing
non-GAAP net income by the weighted- average shares outstanding
as presented in the calculation of GAAP net loss per share. Because
of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective
assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a
company’s non-cash expenses, Workiva believes that providing non-

GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation
expense allows for more meaningful comparisons between its
operating results from period to period. For business combinations,
we generally allocate a portion of the purchase price to intangible
assets. The amount of the allocation is based on estimates and
assumptions made by management and is subject to amortization.
The amount of purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the
term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are
unique to each acquisition and thus we do not believe they are
reflective of ongoing operations.
Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, represents cash flow from
operating activities less purchase of property and equipment. Free
cash flow margin is calculated by dividing free cash flow by total
revenue. We consider free cash flow and free cash flow margin to
be liquidity measures that provide useful information to investors
about the amount of cash generated or used by the business.
Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is
directly comparable to that provided by other companies in
Workiva’s industry, as other companies in the industry may
calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. In addition, there
are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the
non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with
GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by
other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material
impact on Workiva’s reported financial results. Further, stock-based
compensation expense has been and will continue to be for the
foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Workiva’s
business and an important part of the compensation provided to its
employees. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is
not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the
directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with
GAAP. Investors should review the reconciliation of non-GAAP
financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures
included below, and not rely on any single financial measure to
evaluate Workiva’s business.
